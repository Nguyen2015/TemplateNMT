NP VP , NP PP VBZ NP .
ADVP VP , and NP VP .
and RB RB , PRP DT VBP NP .
we &apos;re NP VP . we all bring PRP$ NNS IN NP .
we go IN NP .
we have to deal with NP PP , so NP VP that we all sing , we all dance , we all have art .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique ca@@ dence of NP , NP .
and whether it is the pen@@ an in NP PP , or NP PP , or NP PP , NP PP , or NP PP -- NP VP her@@ der in the slo@@ pes of q@@ om@@ ol@@ ang@@ ma , ever@@ est , the go@@ dd@@ ess mother of the world .
all of these peop@@ les teach us that there are NP , NP , NP .
and this is NP SBAR .
now , together NP PP VB PRT NP - VP VBZ NP .
and NP VP , and NP VP .
the eth@@ no@@ sphere is NP NP .
it &apos;s the symbol of NP CC NP .
and just as NP VP , so too VBZ NP -- and , IN NP , IN NP .
no bi@@ ologists , for example , would d@@ are suggest that 50 percent of NP CC NP have VBN or are IN NP because it simply is not true , and yet that -- the most apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic scen@@ ari@@ o in the real@@ m of NP : ADVP NP what we know to VB NP .
and NP PP , RB RB , VBZ NP .
WRB NP VP , there were NP VP .
now , a language is not just NP PP or NP PP .
a language is NP PP .
it &apos;s a vehicle through which DT NN IN NP comes IN NP .
every language is an JJ HYPH NN forest of NP , NP , NP , NP .
and of those 6@@ ,000 languages , as we sit RB NN IN NP , fully half are no longer being wh@@ is@@ per@@ ed IN NP .
they &apos;re no longer being taught IN NP .
what could be more lon@@ ely than VP or anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ te the promise of the children ?
and yet , that dre@@ ad@@ ful fa@@ te is indeed the p@@ light of NN somewhere IN NP roughly every two weeks , because every two weeks , some el@@ der dies and car@@ ries IN NP IN NP the last sy@@ ll@@ ables of an ancient ton@@ gue .
and i know there &apos;s NP , NP , NP ? &quot; and i say , &quot; great , let NP VP . let &apos;s make it c@@ ant@@ on@@ ese .
let NP VP . &quot;
and you &apos;ll suddenly discover WP NP VP .
and so , what i &apos;d like VP is sort of take PRP IN NP IN NP IN NP , to try VP .
now , there are many IN NP .
take , for example , this child of a bar@@ as@@ ana in NP , NP .
now , this is a people who cogni@@ tively do not dist@@ ingu@@ ish the color blue from the color green because NP VP .
NP VP : S VP .
and this is NP VP , yet the curious thing is IN NP .
NP ADVP VP and ADVP VP .
or , WHNP S , NP VP .
in CD , five mis@@ sion@@ aries VBD NP and VBD NP .
they dro@@ pped IN NP NP SBAR .
NP VP , ADVP NP VP .
but the wa@@ or@@ an@@ i didn NP RB NP .
PRP VBD NP .
5@@ 4 percent of their mortality was due to NP VP .
we tra@@ ced gene@@ alo@@ gi@@ es back eight generations , and we found two in@@ stances of natural death and when we pres@@ su@@ red NP NP IN NP , they ad@@ mit@@ ted that NP PP VBD VP , so we spe@@ ared him anyway .
but IN NP PRP VBD NP .
their h@@ unter@@ s could smell NN NN IN NP and tell PRP WHNP S .
in the early &apos; 8@@ 0s , i had a really ast@@ on@@ ishing as@@ sign@@ ment when i was asked by my professor at harvard if i was interested in going RP IN NP , in@@ fil@@ tr@@ ating NP SBAR NP CC NP , and se@@ cur@@ ing NP VP .
in order to VB NP PP , i had to understand NN IN NP . and vo@@ o@@ do@@ o is not a black magic cul@@ t .
IN NP , PRP VBZ NP .
it &apos;s JJ .
if i asked you to name NP PP , what would you say ?
NN , NN , NN , NN , WDT .
ADVP NP VP , NP VP . UH , RB RB , NP VP and NP VP .
but , what VBZ NP is that NP VP .
so , the living give NN IN NP .
the spi@@ ri@@ ts can be inv@@ o@@ ked from bene@@ ath NP , VP .
that &apos;s why the vo@@ o@@ do@@ o@@ ists like to say that NP VP and speak about NN .
we dance IN NP and become NN . &quot;
and because NP VP , you are VBN PP ?
so you see these ast@@ on@@ ishing demon@@ stra@@ tions : vo@@ o@@ do@@ o ac@@ oly@@ tes in NP PP hand@@ ling burning em@@ bers with NP , NP .
now , of all the peop@@ les WDT NP VP , the most extraordinary are the kog@@ i of NP PP .
NNS IN NP , in NP PP , these people re@@ treated IN NP .
in a b@@ loo@@ d@@ sta@@ ined continent , these people alone were never con@@ qu@@ ered IN NP .
PP , NP VP but NP VP .
NP VP ; ADVP NP VP .
and for this entire time , they are in@@ cul@@ tur@@ ated into the values of NP , NP .
and at NP PP they &apos;re RB VBN PRT and for NP PP , at NP PP , they see DT NN . and in DT JJ NN IN NP as DT NN VBZ S , suddenly everything NP VP is aff@@ ir@@ med IN NP . and the pri@@ est steps RB and says , &quot; NP VP ? it &apos;s RB as NP VP .
PRP VBZ SBAR . PRP VBZ NP S . &quot;
NP VP and NP VP .
now , DT NN IN NP becomes RB JJ .
whenever we think IN NP , we either inv@@ o@@ ke NN and NP PP and say NP VP .
well , indi@@ gen@@ ous people are nei@@ ther JJ nor we@@ ak@@ en@@ ed IN NP .
ADVP NP , but NP VP .
RB , WP VBZ NP VP ?
it means that NP VP and have a different relationship to NP CC NP than NP PP VBD S .
whether it &apos;s NP CC NP is ir@@ relevant .
what &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that defin@@ es the relationship between NP CC NP .
i was raised in the fore@@ sts of british colum@@ bia to believe NP VP .
that made me a different human being than my friends am@@ on@@ gst the k@@ wa@@ gi@@ ul@@ th who believe that those fore@@ sts were NP CC NP and the can@@ ni@@ b@@ al spi@@ ri@@ ts that d@@ well@@ ed at the north end of NP , NP .
now , if you begin to look IN NP IN S , you could begin to understand DT IN NP . take this plant here .
it &apos;s a photograph NP VP .
NP VP , NP PP VBZ NP .
WHNP S VBZ RB NP . NP VP : PP , NP VP -- but NP VP .
this plant had NP , NP .
if NP VP .
to have that po@@ w@@ der blo@@ wn up your nose is rather like being shot out of a ri@@ f@@ le bar@@ re@@ l lin@@ ed with NP CC NP on NP PP .
NP VP ; NP VP .
IN NP , S , NP VP -- NP VP .
but the thing about tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ines is they can not be taken or@@ ally because NP VP .
they can only be taken or@@ ally if taken IN NP IN NP .
now , the fascinating things are that NP VP . so you ask yourself a question .
WRB , IN NP , VBP NP VP ?
well , we use NP , NP .
but NP VP , and NP VP . &quot;
UH , WP VBZ NP VP ?
NP , NP , VBZ NP .
and then you ask them how NP VP and NP VP .
i mean , don &apos; t NP VP ? &quot; and i said , &quot; DT . &quot;
UH , NP VP , and NP VP .
now , that &apos;s not going to get NP NP , but it &apos;s a lot more interesting than coun@@ ting stam@@ ens .
now -- -- the problem -- the problem is that even DT IN NP view PRP IN NP but somehow re@@ duced IN NP IN NP , VP .
well , the truth is NP SBAR . now , DT NN IN NP .
all cultures through all time have constantly been enga@@ ged IN NP IN NP .
and the problem is not NP ADVP .
the si@@ ou@@ x indi@@ ans did not stop being si@@ ou@@ x when they gave up the bo@@ w and ar@@ row NP VP .
it VBZ RB VP or NP SBAR . it is NP , NP .
wher@@_ever you look around the world , you discover that these are not cultures dest@@_ined to fa@@_de away ; these are dynamic living peop@@_les being driven out of existence by identi@@_fi@@_able forces that are beyond their capacity to ada@@_pt to : whether it &apos;s the e@@_gre@@_gi@@_ous de@@_for@@_est@@_ation in the hom@@_eland of the pen@@_an -- a no@@_ma@@_di@@_c people from sou@@_the@@_ast asia , from sar@@_a@@_wa@@_k -- a people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago , and now have all been re@@_duced to ser@@_vi@@_tude and pro@@_stit@@_ution on the ban@@_ks of the ri@@_vers , where you can see the river itself is so@@_iled with the si@@_lt that seems to be carrying half of bor@@_ne@@_o away to the south china sea , where the japanese frei@@_gh@@_ters hang light in the hori@@_zon ready to fill their hol@@_ds with ra@@_w lo@@_gs ri@@_pped from the forest -- or , in the case of the y@@_an@@_o@@_mam@@_i , it &apos;s the disease enti@@_ties that have come in , in the wake of the discovery of gold .
or if we go IN NP , where i &apos;m VP , you &apos;ll see NP VP .
you know , geno@@ cide , NP VP , but NP VP , PRP VBZ ADVP , in many quar@@ ters , cele@@ br@@ ated as NP PP .
and you can not understand the pain of ti@@ bet until you move IN NP IN NP .
NP ADVP VP , and NP VP .
this young man &apos;s father had been as@@ cri@@ bed IN NP .
that meant NP VP .
his un@@ cle fl@@ ed IN NP IN NP .
his mother was in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated IN NP .
he was s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ed IN NP VP .
the sister who had done that bra@@ ve de@@ ed was put IN NP .
one day she in@@ ad@@ ver@@ t@@ ently ste@@ pped on NP PP , and for that trans@@ gr@@ ession , she was given NP PP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
and in DT NN , then , it really comes RP IN NP : do NP VP ?
mar@@ gar@@ et me@@ ad , the great anthropo@@ log@@ ist , said , before NP VP , that NP VP , but that NP VP .
and it &apos;s hum@@ bling to remember that NP VP .
the ne@@ oli@@ th@@ ic revolution -- which gave us agriculture , at WDT NN NP VP ; NP VP ; NP VP -- is only 10,000 years ago .
the modern industrial world as PRP know NP VP .
now , that NP VP .
WRB NP VP , they respond IN NP .
and it &apos;s IN NP . and there are NP PP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
NP VP , and PP , S , NP VP .
this old man &apos;s NP VP .
the family , fe@@ ar@@ ful IN NP , took away DT IN NP , DT IN NP .
ADVP , NP VP ; NP VP .
the run@@ ners of their sle@@ ds were origin@@ ally made of NP VP .
so , this man &apos;s grand@@ father was not inti@@ mid@@ ated by NP CC NP .
he simply VBD ADVP , VBD PRT NP and VBD PP . and as NP VP , he sha@@ ped PRP IN NP .
NP VP and SBAR , NP VP .
he sk@@ inn@@ ed the dog and impro@@ vis@@ ed a har@@ ness , took DT NN IN NP and impro@@ vis@@ ed a s@@ led , har@@ n@@ essed up an ad@@ jac@@ ent dog , and disappe@@ ared over NP , NP .
talk about getting by IN NP .
and this , in many ways -- -- is a symbol of NP PP and IN NP .
the can@@ adi@@ an government in NP PP gave back to NP PP .
PRP VBZ NP . PRP VBZ VP .
PRP VBZ NP . PRP VBP NP .
an amazing example of how a nation - state can se@@ ek NN IN NP .
and finally , in the end , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious at least to all of NP SBAR , to realize that NP VP .
they &apos;re NP PP .
they represent NP PP . and for NP PP , DT NNS IN NP , IN NP , become NP PP .
so , what we &apos;re trying to do IN NP , finally , is , we believe that politicians will RB VB NP .
we think that NNS -- -- we think that NP VP , but we think IN S , and so we are RB NP PP . we get 35 million hits on our website every month .
CD NNS VBP NP .
our maga@@ zin@@ es are read IN NP .
and what we &apos;re doing is a series of jour@@ ne@@ ys to the eth@@ no@@ sphere WRB NP VP : that this world deser@@ ves to exist IN NP , that we can VB NP S .
VBP NP ADVP .
WP NP VP , RB RB as NP VP , is NP , NP . DT VBZ NP , and PRP VBZ NP .
we &apos;re VP .
and it doesn &apos; t matter WHADJP NN NP VP , WRB JJ NP VP or WRB JJ NP VP .
NP PP VBP NP , but NP VP , and NP VP .
it doesn &apos; t make any difference because NP VP . it &apos;s also very flexi@@ ble architecture .
NP VP , so NP VP .
DT VBZ NP . DT NN VBZ NP .
S , NP VP ; NP VP .
maybe this is NP PP .
i wouldn NP VP .
DT VBZ NP . DT VBZ NP .
every large image is NP PP .
and this really gives PRP NP CC NP .
we &apos;ve also done a little something with NP PP .
NP VP -- and NP VP .
if NP VP , you can VB NP ADVP .
or NP , CC NP .
and this really gets at NP ADVP VP .
we hope that NP VP .
of course , ma@@ pping is NP PP .
and this one i really won NP VP .
but those are NP PP .
super@@ im@@ posed IN NP .
so let NP VP , now , something else .
NP VP ; NP VP .
this is NP VP .
NP VP and NP VP .
and NN NN IN NP . a RB JJ collaboration .
and so this is live IN NP . it &apos;s powered IN NP .
you can see that when we kind of do these sorts of vie@@ ws , where we can di@@ ve IN NP and have NP PP .
but DT JJ NN IN NP here is RB JJ .
the computer vision algorith@@ ms have regi@@ ster@@ ed these images together so that they cor@@ respond IN NP . so you see elements here of stabili@@ zed NP CC NP , and these things have all been related spa@@ tially .
i &apos;m not sure if NP VP .
there are NP SBAR .
i would like to jump straight to one of NP NP -- and this is from an early prototyp@@ e of photo@@ syn@@ th that we first got working IN NP -- to show you what i think S . and it &apos;s not necessarily so appar@@ ent from looking at the environments that we &apos;ve put up on the website .
we had VP .
DT VBZ NP . NP ADVP VP , and NP VP . and NP PP VBZ NP .
and ADVP NP VP , and NP VP .
and we can just navi@@ gate IN NP .
you know , i never thought that NP VP .
it &apos;s very gra@@ ti@@ fying to have DT NN IN NP here .
NP VP : NP VP .
and if NP VP , i &apos;ll VB NP .
NP PP VBP VP .
ADVP NP VP -- ADVP NP VP .
this is actually DT NN IN NP .
we can di@@ ve in IN NP to NP PP .
what the point here really is is that we can do NNS IN NP . this is now taking data from NN -- from NP PP -- and link all of that together .
NP VP , and NP VP .
you have a model that emer@@ ges IN NP .
NP PP VBZ NP .
and this is something that gro@@ ws in complexity as people use it , and whose benefits become JJR IN NP as NP VP .
their own photos are getting tag@@ ged IN NP .
if somebody bo@@ ther@@ ed IN NP NP PP and say WHNP S , then my photo of not@@ re d@@ ame ca@@ the@@ d@@ ral suddenly gets en@@ rich@@ ed with NP PP , and i can use PRP IN NP IN NP , IN NP , VP , and do DT NN IN NP .
and RB RB , NP VP NP , VP .
VBP NP ADVP .
do i understand this right ? that WP NP VP , is IN S ?
yes . WP NP VP is VBG .
it &apos;s creating NP PP .
and it &apos;s doing that based IN NP .
and that gets really exciting when you think about NP PP that NP VP .
like when you do NP PP , NP PP , and NP PP is carrying a lot of NN about WP NP VP .
now , what if NP PP ?
then DT NN IN NP and NP PP WHNP S is really huge . it &apos;s a classi@@ c network effect .
bla@@ ise , that is RB JJ . con@@ gr@@ at@@ u@@ lations .
NNS RB RB .
NP VP , and NP VP , PP NP VP .
i want to start with WP NP VP . &quot;
DT JJ NN IN NP ?
DT JJ NN IN NP .
and the offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma runs IN NP : if NP VP , the way VP is VP .
the reason for DT is both that NP VP .
and because if NNS VBP NP , then each of PRP can act IN NP VP , and no one has to decide IN NP .
the way to VB NP is to VB NP .
the more choice people have NP NP .
this , i think , is so deeply em@@ bed@@ ded in the water supply that it wouldn NP VP .
and it &apos;s also RB em@@ bed@@ ded IN NP .
i &apos;ll VB NP NP .
DT VBZ NP . not PDT DT JJ NN .
i want to say RB DT NN IN NP .
17@@ 5 sal@@ ad d@@ res@@ s@@ ings in my super@@ market , if you don &apos; t count the 10 extra@@ -@@ virg@@ in o@@ live o@@ ils and 12 bal@@ sam@@ ic vin@@ eg@@ ars you could buy to make a very large number of your own sal@@ ad d@@ res@@ s@@ ings , in the off - chance that none of NP NP has on NN NN you .
so this is WP NP VP .
and then you go to the consumer electr@@ on@@ ics store to set up DT NN NN -- NP , NP , NP , NP , NP -- and in this one single consumer electr@@ on@@ ics store , there are that many stere@@ o systems .
we can constru@@ ct six - and - a-half-million different stere@@ o systems out of the components that are IN NP .
you &apos;ve got to ad@@ mit NP VP .
IN NP -- NP PP .
ADVP VBD NP , SBAR NP VP .
you r@@ ented PRP$ NN . you didn NP VP .
NP PP , IN NP , VBZ SBAR .
and DT NNS VBP VP .
we now have NP PP , RB IN NP .
these are NP PP .
my favorite is the middle one -- NP , NP , and cre@@ me bru@@ lee tor@@ ch .
and IN PP NP VP .
and what this does is it leads people to walk IN NP VP .
and do you know what DT NN IN NP now is ?
DT NN VBZ ADJP NP . &quot;
it is not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn NP VP .
so , in NP PP , DT JJ NN IN NP is JJ .
health care -- NP VP , and NP VP .
RB , NP VP , and NP VP , NP VP , or NP VP .
a has NP , CC NP .
NN VBZ NP . WP VBP NP VP ? &quot;
CC NP VP , VBP NP , what should PRP VB ? &quot;
and the do@@ c says , &quot; NP VP , and NP VP .
what do you want VP ? &quot;
and you say , &quot; if NP VP , do@@ c , what would you do ? &quot;
CC NP VP but NP VP . &quot;
and the result is -- NP VP VBZ NP NP .
ADVP NP NP PP .
why do they market to us if we can &apos; NP VP ?
the answer is that NP VP .
something as JJ IN NP has now become DT NN IN NP , as NP VP .
NP VP ; NP VP .
and we get to re-@@ inv@@ ent ourselves as often as NP VP .
and that means that everyday , WRB NP VP , you have VP .
with respect to marriage and family , there was a time when the de@@ fau@@ lt assu@@ mption that NP VP is that NP VP , and then you started having kids as soon as you could .
NP VP , and RB SBAR .
no@@ wa@@ days , everything is very much up IN NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
and it &apos;s not because NP VP , and NP VP .
NP VP MD NP VP ? should PRP VB VP ?
should PRP VB VP ? should PRP VB NP ? &quot;
DT IN NP are VBG NP .
and they &apos;re going VP and not getting NP PP .
and indeed they should . these are important questions VP .
NN -- NP VP .
there is one corner , by DT NN , that NP VP , WRB NP VP .
i &apos;m not telling you about PRP because NP VP .
so what this means , this incredible freedom of choice we have IN NP IN NP , is that we have to VP CC VP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
and even if NP VP , we are RB VBG NP , NP ?
should i respond IN NP ? should i dra@@ ft DT NN ? &quot;
and even if the answer to the question is &quot; no , &quot; it &apos;s certainly going to make DT NN IN NP NN NN RB JJ than NP VP .
so everywhere NP VP , big things and NP , NP CC NP , NN is DT NN IN NP .
and the world NP VP .
NP VP , S , but NP VP .
and the world we now live IN NP .
and the question is , is NP , CC NP ?
and DT NN VBZ INTJ .
NP ADVP VP , so NP VP .
DT IN NP has NP , NP .
one effect , parado@@ x@@ ically , is that NP VP .
IN NP , NNS VBP S .
i &apos;ll VB NP NP .
DT NN IN NP got NN IN NP IN NP .
and what she found is that for NP NP VBN , rate of NN went down two percent .
NP VP -- NP VP . WRB ?
because with 50 fun@@ ds to choose from , it &apos;s so dam@@ n hard to decide which fund to choose that NP VP .
and NP , CC NP , CC NP RB VBZ .
understand that not only does this mean that NP VP , it also means that S VP .
by not VBG , they are pas@@ sing RP NP NP IN NP .
so paraly@@ sis is NP PP .
and i think NP VP .
you really want to get the decision right if NP VP ?
you don NP VP .
so that &apos;s one effect . the second effect is that even if we manage TO VP , we end up less satis@@ fied IN NP than NP VP .
and there are NP PP .
one of them is that with a lot of different sal@@ ad d@@ res@@ s@@ ings to choose from , if NP VP , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and , you know , what sal@@ ad d@@ res@@ sing is ? -- it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have VBN NP . and what happens is this imag@@ ined NP VP , and NP VP you get out of the decision you made , even if it was a good decision .
the more op@@ tions NP VP is dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting IN NP WDT NP VP .
second , WDT NP VP . &quot;
dan gil@@ bert made a big point this morning of talking about how much the way in which we value things depen@@ ds on what we compare NP VP .
well , when there are NNS IN NP , it is easy to VB NP .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who aren NP NP , i apo@@ logi@@ ze .
but here &apos;s WP NP VP .
here &apos;s DT NN IN NP .
RB JJ JJ NN .
gor@@ ge@@ ous beach . beautiful day . they have PRP DT IN NP .
what could be JJR ? &quot; well , dam@@ n it , &quot; NP VP , &quot; NP VP .
NN IN NP is RB .
i could be par@@ king right in NN IN NP . &quot;
and he sp@@ ends NP VP .
opportunity costs sub@@ tra@@ ct from the satis@@ fac@@ tion NP VP .
and the more op@@ tions NP VP are going VP .
RB VB NP .
now this carto@@ on makes NP PP .
it makes points about VP .
but one point NP VP is that SBAR , NP VP .
and NP VP , and NP VP .
ADVP : NN IN NP .
this hit me WRB NP VP .
i wear NNS RB NP .
and there was NP SBAR .
ADVP NP VP , and NP VP . RB VB NP . &quot;
S , NP VBP NP VP ?
you want NN NN CC NN VB ? you want ADJP CC NP - washed ?
do you want NP ADJP ?
NP VP ... S VP .
NP VP , and SBAR , NP VP . &quot;
PRP VBD NP , so NP VP , and NP VP ! -- IN NP PRP VBD ADVP VP .
i did better . all this choice made it possible IN NP TO VP .
but PRP VBD ADJP .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try to explain DT IN NP .
the reason NP VP is IN , IN NP available , my expec@@ tations about WHADJP S .
NP VP -- NP VP .
WRB NP VP , CD IN NP should VB VP .
and SBAR VP , but NP VP .
and so i compared WP NP VP , and WDT NP VP .
ad@@ ding op@@ tions to people &apos;s lives can &apos; t help but increase the expec@@ tations NP VP about WRB JJ NP VP .
and what that NP VP VBZ NP .
nobody in the world of NN knows this , because if NP VP , you wouldn NP SBAR .
the truth is RBR IN NP .
the reason that NP VP is that SBAR , NP VP .
no@@ wa@@ days , the world NP VP is as good as NP VP .
you will never be pleas@@ antly surprised because NP VP .
the secret to NN -- this VP -- the secret IN NP expec@@ tations .
NP VP , and NP VP .
i couldn S . i didn NP VP .
but VP NP NP .
finally , one con@@ sequence of buying DT ADJP NN IN NP is that when NP VP , and NP VP , the answer is clear : the world is responsible . what could you do ?
when EX VBP NP , and NP VP , and NP VP , who &apos;s responsible ?
it is equ@@ ally clear that NP VP .
you could VB VP .
with NP PP , there is NP PP .
and so WRB NP VP , and even though NP PP VBP ADJP , they feel dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted IN NP ; they bl@@ ame themselves .
clinical depression has explo@@ ded IN NP .
NP VP -- S , CC S .
and so the net result is that NP VP , and NP VP .
so let NP VP .
this is NP , NP , and it &apos;s NP ADJP . it is not true .
there NNS DT NN that NP VP , but it doesn NP VP .
there &apos;s some ma@@ gical amount . i don NP VP .
i &apos;m pretty confi@@ dent that NP VP .
now , as a policy matter -- NP VP -- as a policy matter , the thing to think RB is this : what en@@ ables S .
NP VP , and NP VP .
their problem is that NP VP .
so the stuff NP VP is DT JJ NN IN NP .
and WP VP is NP : S . it &apos;s NP PP .
what PRP VBP S is that NP : NP VP .
PRP RB VBD .
they actually make NP ADJP .
SBAR NP VP , but NP VP .
this is WP NP VP . &quot;
income re@@ distribution will make everyone better off -- not just poor people -- because of WRB NP NP .
so to conclu@@ de . you &apos;re supposed VP ! what does this fish know ?
you know , nothing is possible IN NP . &quot;
NP , NP VBZ NP .
the more i thought about it , however , the more NP VP .
because NP VP , you don S . you have NN .
if you sh@@ at@@ ter this fis@@ h@@ bow@@ l so that NP VP , you de@@ cre@@ ase satis@@ fac@@ tion .
NP VP , and NP VP .
NN VBZ NP .
NP VP -- FRAG , FRAG .
but NP VP , and , NP VP .
VBP NP ADVP .
NP VP , NP VP , and VP .
we &apos;re actually starting at a new point : we &apos;ve been di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zing biology , and now we &apos;re trying to go IN NP IN NP IN S .
so , we &apos;ve always been trying to VB NP .
&quot; what is life ? &quot; is something that i think NP VP .
we &apos;ve VBN NP , S .
NP VP ; SBAR , NP VP .
now we &apos;re VP ? &quot;
NP VP , and NP VP .
we &apos;re able to kno@@ ck RP IN NP out of NP SBAR .
when we look S -- trust NP , NP VP -- but when we look IN NP , it &apos;s very un@@ likely that this would VB NP .
so we decided the only way forward was to actually syn@@ thes@@ ize this chromo@@ some so NP VP .
and so we started RP NP PP : can PRP VB NP ?
can NP VP ?
and if NP VP , can we boot RP DT NN ?
DT NN , IN NP , is RB NP PP .
so , our p@@ ace of di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zing life has been increasing IN NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
we started DT IN NP IN .
it took several st@@ ages , in fact , starting with DT JJ NN before NP VP .
but it turns out NP VP .
NP VP and NP VP , so DT RBR PRP VBP NP .
so we had to VB NP PP and VB NP .
and this was our first attemp@@ t , starting IN NP .
it &apos;s NP SBAR .
we designed DT NNS , went IN NP and had NP PP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
the vi@@ ral particles then were VBN PP and came RB and killed NP .
NP VP and NP VP .
they laugh@@ ed NP VP .
and so , we think NP VP .
but we wanted to go much larger : we wanted to build the entire bacteri@@ al chromo@@ some -- it &apos;s over 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 letters of genetic code -- so we thought we &apos;d build them in NP NP so NP VP .
design is JJ , and if NP VP has VP .
WRB NP ADVP VP , DT NN IN NP was NP PP .
we actually found , on res@@ equ@@ en@@ cing NP , NP : VP , it never would have been JJ S .
part of the design is designing pieces that are 50 letters long that have to over@@ la@@ p with all the other 50 - letter pieces to build smaller sub@@ un@@ its NP VP .
we design JJ NNS IN NP .
you may have read that NP VP .
NP : S -- NP , NP .
tri@@ ple@@ ts of NP PP .
so we can VB NP S .
ini@@ tially , all we did VBD NP NP .
some people were dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted NP VP .
NP VP ; NP VP .
and we started VBG NP , VBG PP , put those together to VB NP , then put sets of NP VP .
at each stage , we grew up these pieces in ab@@ und@@ ance so we could sequence them because NP VP .
we &apos;re trying to get IN NP .
so , this looks IN NP .
SBAR , NP VP -- NP VP -- and ADVP NP VP .
we knew NP VP .
ADVP VP NP : NP VP .
you can see IN NP , its chromo@@ some just gets blo@@ wn apart .
t@@ wel@@ ve to 24 hours later , it put it back together exactly as NP VP .
we have NP PP .
NP VP ; NP VP .
i am absolutely certain that NP VP .
in fact , nasa has shown NP VP .
ADVP VP NP NP VP ; NP VP .
NP VP ; NP VP .
it &apos;s such a large molecule NP VP .
these are pictures over IN NP .
so , this is the publi@@ cation NP VP .
NP VP ; NP VP .
it &apos;s IN NP .
if PRP VBD NP PRT PP , it takes 14@@ 2 pages just to NP NP .
UH , WRB VBP NP VP ? WRB VBP NP VP ?
RB , PP NP VP ; NP VP .
it &apos;s also simpl@@ er when you go into NP PP : you can just pop out the nu@@ cle@@ us and pop in DT CD , and that &apos;s what you &apos;ve NP VP .
with bacteria and arch@@ a@@ e@@ a , the chromo@@ some is integr@@ ated IN NP , but we recently showed that NP VP .
NP VP -- ADVP , NP VP -- S , S , CC S -- and NP VP .
the new chromo@@ some went IN NP .
PP , NP VP , but NP VP .
this is NP PP RB .
we find all kinds of species that have taken up a second chromo@@ some or a third one from somewhere , ad@@ ding NP PP IN NP .
so , people who think IN NP IN NP have mis@@ sed much of NN .
there are NP VP .
NP VP ; NP VP .
S CC S , and ADVP NP VP .
it turned blue because PP NP VP .
and PP , NP VP and NP VP .
NP VP ; SBAR , NP VP .
ADVP , NP VP , but NP VP .
now NP VP , NP VP ; this is VBG PP .
and i &apos;ve argu@@ ed that NP VP .
WRB VB NP ?
i think NP VP .
we &apos;re about to go IN NP IN NP .
VP : NP VP .
NP VP ; PP , NP VP .
we have NP VP .
it &apos;s going to be a stre@@ tch to do PRP IN NP .
we use over five billion tons of NN , CD billion - plus bar@@ rel@@ s of oil -- that &apos;s NP NP .
when we try to think of NP CC NP TO VP , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
then of course , there &apos;s all that co2 IN NP .
NP ADVP , PP , VP , and NP VP .
the electr@@ on@@ ics industry only had a do@@ zen or so components , and look at the diversity that came IN IN NP .
we &apos;re limited here RB by NP CC NP .
we now have techniques , because of NP PP , to do WP NP VP .
we have NP RB VP .
when you think of process@@ ing these 20 million different genes or trying to optimi@@ ze processes to produce NN or to produce NP , NP , we can just with a small team , do more molecular biology than the last 20 years of all science .
CC NP VP : NP VP .
this is NP PP .
NP VP : NP VP .
we &apos;re foc@@ using IN ADVP NP .
NP VP , NP PP VBZ ADVP NP .
we have NP SBAR .
but NP VP , and ADVP NP VP .
and we think we NP VP .
NN CC NN VBZ NP ...
but in NP PP , we have NP PP .
this is an organis@@ m NP VP .
it lives in DT JJ NN , IN NP , almost IN NP .
it takes co2 to NP VP .
we &apos;re looking to see if NP VP .
so , in DT JJ NN IN NP , we think that NP VP ? &quot;
we ADVP , NP VP , have NP PP . if NP VP , where can PRP ? -- become NP PP ...
but also , we &apos;re now working on using these same tools to come up with NP PP .
NP VP ; NP VP and DT NN JJ WRB NP VP .
i think NP VP .
here &apos;s WP NP VP .
NP VP : NP VP . VBP NP ADVP .
JJ NN IN NP PRP VBD NP PP .
and i promis@@ ed to come back and give you an up@@ date on WRB NP VP .
so this is PRP . and for NP SBAR , the l@@ h@@ c is NP : NP .
its job is to re@@ create NP , NP .
it &apos;s NP SBAR .
this is NP PP .
we take NP VP .
this is NP SBAR . it &apos;s VBN NP .
spec@@ tac@@ ular picture here of at@@ las under construction so NP VP .
on DT NN IN NP last year we turned the machine on IN NP .
and this picture was taken IN NP .
it caused JJ NN IN NP .
it &apos;s NP PP VP .
in other words , when we saw that NP NP-TMP NP VP , which is a great tri@@ um@@ ph .
i don NP VP .
it means NP VP .
about a week later NP VP , related RB IN NP RB -- these gold wir@@ es .
those wir@@ es carry 13 thousand am@@ ps when the machine is working IN NP .
now the engineers am@@ on@@ gst you will look at them and say , &quot; no NP VP t . they &apos;re small wir@@ es . &quot;
they can do that because SBAR NP VP .
so IN NP 2@@ 7@@ 1 degrees , ADJP PP , those wir@@ es can VB NP .
in one of NP PP , there was a manufacturing de@@ fe@@ ct .
RB NP VP , and NP ADVP VP .
DT VBD NP .
ADVP NP VP , and NP VP .
so we dama@@ ged NP PP .
we had to take them out , WDT NP VP .
we re@@ condi@@ tioned NP NP .
they &apos;re DT IN NP back under@@ ground now .
IN NP DT NN MD VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
now of course , in DT NN those acci@@ dents rei@@ gni@@ te NP PP IN NP . it &apos;s JJ S .
i think that NP VP .
NP VP , NP VP . &quot;
VBP NP .
PRP VBP NP .
NP VP but NP VP .
it is RB NP CC NP .
and i don NP VP .
but , that said , something kind of pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar has happened recently IN NP and IN NP .
and the pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar thing is that i recently wrote NP , NP .
NP WHPP VP , people treat PRP IN S .
RB -- VP !
UH , S ADVP , NP ADJP , and NP VP , VP NP VP ?
aren &apos; t you afraid NP VP and you &apos;re never again going to create a book WDT NP VP ? &quot;
so that NP ADJP , you know .
but it would be worse , except PP NP VP .
and people would say , &quot; aren &apos; t you afraid NP VP ?
aren &apos; t you afraid NP VP ?
aren &apos; t NP ADJP and NP VP and NP VP ? &quot;
IN NP , PRP VBP .
NP : S , NP INTJ . &quot;
yes , i &apos;m afraid IN NP .
and PRP RB VBP VP .
and i &apos;m afraid IN NP .
like NP , CC NP WHNP S .
but , when it comes IN NP , the thing that PRP VBP VP , is why ?
NP VP , VBZ NP ADJP ?
is it logi@@ cal that NP VP .
NP VP , and SBAR , NP VP ?
IN NP , IN NP , VBD NP and PRP VBP NP ADVP PP , you know ?
it didn &apos; t -- that NP , how &apos;s NP VP ?
it just didn NP VP , you know ?
but VP , NP PP RB VBD NP PP .
NP , NP ADVP VP , and not ADVP NP , but NP PP , S , VBP NP .
and all NP VP is VB PP ?
and even the ones who didn &apos; t literally com@@ mit NP VP , you know .
nor@@ man ma@@ il@@ er , just before he died , JJ NN , he said &quot; NP VP . &quot;
an extraordinary stat@@ ement to make IN NP &apos;s work , you know .
but NP VP and ADVP NP VP NP SBAR .
and the question that i want VP is are you guys NP VP ?
are you comfortable with that -- because NP VP and , NP VP -- i &apos;m not at all comfortable with that assu@@ mption .
i think NP VP .
and i also think NP VP , and NP VP .
i think NP VP .
and i definitely know that , PP NP VP .
which is -- NP VP , INTJ VP , NP VP , i &apos;m only about 40 years old .
i still have maybe DT CD NNS IN NP left IN NP .
and it &apos;s ex@@ ce@@ ed@@ ingly likely that anything NP VP forward is going VP ?
NP VP -- NP VP .
UH , ADVP NP , WHNP NP !
NP VP , and NP VP .
i would pre@@ fer to keep doing this work WDT NP VP .
and RB , DT NN VBZ , ADVP ?
and so , it seems IN NP , IN NP ?
i have to sort of find some way to have DT JJ NN IN NP , as NP VP , and my very natural an@@ x@@ iety about what DT NN IN NP is VBG S , from now on .
and , IN S NP VP , and NP VP .
and that search has led me to NP CC NP .
so stay with PRP , because NP VP .
but , ancient gre@@ e@@ ce and ancient ro@@ me -- people did not happen to believe that NP VP , o@@ .@@ k. ?
people believed that NP VP .
the gre@@ e@@ ks fam@@ ously called NP PP . &quot;
soc@@ rates , fam@@ ously , believed that NP VP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
which is great , because NP VP .
they believed that NP VP , WP VP , and WP VP and would shape DT NN IN NP .
RB JJ -- ADVP NP VP .
and everyone knew that NP VP ?
so the ancient artist was prote@@ cted IN NP ?
if NP VP , everybody knew IN S .
if NP VP , not entirely your fau@@ lt , you know ?
everyone knew NP VP .
and this is how people thought IN NP IN NP .
and ADVP NP VP and NP VP , and NP VP , and NP VP .
and NP VP , and NP VP .
and for the first time in history , you start to hear people refer@@ ring to NP CC NP as VP rather than having a geni@@ us .
and i got to tell NP , NP VP .
you know , i think that VP VP NP .
it &apos;s like asking somebody to VB NP .
NP ADVP ADVP VP , and NP VP .
and i think NP VP .
and , if NP VP , and NP VP , the question VBZ , NP ADVP ?
can PRP VB NP ADVP ?
maybe go back to some more ancient understanding about the relationship between NP CC NP .
RB not .
maybe we can &apos; NP VP .
and there &apos;s probably people in this audience who would raise really legi@@ ti@@ mate scientific sus@@ pi@@ ci@@ ons about NP PP .
NP VP , RB , VP .
but DT NN WHNP S is -- NP VP ?
why not think about NP NP ?
because it makes as much sense as anything else i have ever heard in terms of expla@@ ining NP PP .
a process which , as anybody who has ever tried to VB NP -- which is to say basically everyone here -@@ -- knows does not always be@@ have ration@@ ally .
and , IN NP , MD ADVP VP .
PRP VBD NP ADVP SBAR , but NP VP and NP VP .
and she said NP VP .
and it would come bar@@ rel@@ ing down at NP PP .
and she felt it VBG , because NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP . &quot;
and she would run like hell to the house and she would be getting ch@@ ased by this po@@ em , and the whole deal was that she had to get to DT NN IN NP fast enough so that when it th@@ under@@ ed IN NP , she could collect PRP and gra@@ b PRP IN NP .
and other times she wouldn &apos; t be fast enough , so she &apos;d VB VP , and she wouldn NP VP and the po@@ em would NN IN NP and she would miss PRP and she said NP VP , as she put it &quot; for another po@@ et . &quot;
and then there were these times -- NP VP -- NP VP , right ?
so , NP VP and NP VP and NP VP , and NP VP , and ADVP NP VP , PRP VBD SBAR and PRP MD VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
and in these in@@ stances , the po@@ em would come up IN NP but RB , IN NP to DT JJ .
so when i heard that NP VP .
NP VP -- NP VP !
NP VP , and NP VP .
but even i , in my mu@@ li@@ sh@@ ness , even i have br@@ us@@ hed RP IN NP , IN NP .
and i would imagine that NP VP .
NP VP , ADVP NP VP or NP VP .
and WP VBZ NP ?
and how are we to rel@@ ate IN NP IN NP ?
and for me , the best con@@ temporary example that i have of how to do NP VP wa@@ its , who i got to interview several years ago on a magazine as@@ sign@@ ment .
and NP VP , and NP VP , NP , PP NP VP , VP .
but ADVP NP VP , NP VP , and NP-TMP NP VP , and DT VBZ SBAR .
and NP VP , and S , CC S , NP VP , NP VP , and S , CC S .
NP VP , NP VP , NP VP .
ADVP NP VP , and ADVP NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP . &quot;
and instead of VP , he just stopped .
NP ADVP VP and NP VP .
NP ADVP VP , and NP VP ? &quot;
&quot; do i look like NP VP ?
if NP ADVP VP , come RB IN NP .
otherwise , go VB NP NP-TMP .
go VB NP . &quot;
and his whole work process changed IN NP .
NP , NP VBD ADVP PP PP .
but NP , CC NP VBD VP .
it could be NP PP .
so when i heard that story it started to shift NP NP WHNP S , and it already saved me once .
NP , NP VP and NP VP and NP VP and NP VP , NP VP .
RB ADJP , but NP VP .
and i started to think NP VP .
but ADVP NP VP and NP VP .
ADVP NP ADVP VP and NP VP .
and NP VP , NP VP , FRAG S ?
because you can see that i am putting everything NP VP , i don &apos; t have any more than this .
RB if NP VP , then you &apos;ve S .
o@@ .@@ k. but if NP VP .
i &apos;m going to keep writing anyway because NP VP .
and i would please like the record to refle@@ ct today that NP VP . &quot;
because -- in the end NP VP -- cent@@ u@@ ries ago in DT NNS IN NP , people used to ga@@ ther IN NP .
and they were always magni@@ fi@@ cent , because NP VP and NP VP , right ?
but NP VP , and NP VP .
and i know you know WP NP VP , because i know NP VP .
it was like NP VP , and the dan@@ cer would RB RB VB PP and he wasn NP VP , NP IN , but everything would al@@ ig@@ n .
and DT IN NP , he would no longer appear VP .
NP VP and NP VP .
and WRB NP VP , they called PRP IN NP .
NP VP and NP VP . &quot;
NP VP , PRP VBP .
curious histor@@ ical foot@@ note -- SBAR , NP VP and NP VP .
in spa@@ in , when a perfor@@ mer has done NP , NP , ADJP , ADJP , NP , ADJP , NP , NP , there it is -- a gli@@ mp@@ se of god .
which is great , because NP VP .
but , NP VP , and NP VP .
NP VP , and ADVP NP VP .
and maybe nobody will ever ch@@ ant god &apos;s name again as he sp@@ ins , and what is he then to do IN NP ?
this is JJ .
this is one of the most pain@@ ful re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ations to make IN NP .
but maybe it doesn NP VP .
but maybe if you just believed that they were IN NP IN NP IN NP .
and , NP VP it starts VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
and WDT NP VP .
VB NP VP .
RB VB NP .
continue to show up for PRP$ NN IN NP , WDT NP VP .
if NP VP , do PRP$ NN .
if NP VP , then &quot; JJ ! &quot;
and IN FRAG , VB NP ADVP .
and &quot; JJ ! &quot; IN NP .
NP VP and NP VP .
&quot; o@@ le ! &quot; to you , non@@ eth@@ eless , just for having NP VP .
VBP NP .
VBP NP .
o@@ le !
last year i showed these two sli@@ des so that demon@@ strate that NP VP .
but this under@@ states the seri@@ ousness of this particular problem because it doesn NP VP .
the arc@@ tic ice ca@@ p is , IN NP , NP PP .
it exp@@ ands IN NP IN NP .
the next slide i show NP VP happened over the last 25 years .
DT JJ NN VBZ VP .
as NP VP , it exp@@ ands IN NP , and it contra@@ cts IN NP .
DT ADJP JJ NN , NP ADJP , NP VP is almost like NN , sp@@ ill@@ ing IN IN NP RB .
in 25 years it &apos;s gone IN NP , IN NP .
this is a problem because NP VP .
compared to the total amount of JJ NN NN IN NP , that amount could double if we cross NP VP .
already in some s@@ hal@@ low la@@ kes in NN , me@@ than@@ e is ac@@ tively bub@@ bling up out IN NP .
NN NN NN IN NP went RP IN NP IN NP JJ NN .
who@@ a !
she &apos;s okay . the question is whether NP VP .
and one reason is , NP VP .
DT VBZ NP .
but the vol@@ um@@ es are much larger than RB .
this is NP PP .
if you want to know how sea level ris@@ es IN NP this is where it reach@@ es the sea .
DT NNS VBP VP .
at DT JJ NN IN NP , ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a the largest mass of NP PP .
last month scientists repor@@ ted NP VP .
and west ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a cro@@ pped up on NN DT IN HYPH NP , is particularly ra@@ pid IN NP .
that &apos;s equal to NP PP , as VP .
IN NP , NP PP : PP NP VP .
CD NN IN NP get NP PP IN NP .
IN NP , DT NN VBZ NP .
DT NNS VBP VP .
but WRB NP VP , so does RB PP .
in california there has been NP PP .
this is VBG NP .
and the predic@@ tions , as NP VP , are serious .
this dr@@ ying IN NP has lead IN NP .
and the dis@@ ast@@ ers around the world have been increasing IN NP .
QP PP as IN NP .
DT VBZ NP .
if you look at in DT NN IN NP you can see what this is doing .
in the last five years we &apos;ve ad@@ ded 70 million tons of NP NP -- NP NP to the oceans .
look carefully IN NP , IN NP , and IN NP .
NP , SBAR , VBZ NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
the united states is NP PP .
and the pro@@ pos@@ al has been VP .
but we &apos;re beginning to VB NP .
here are the ones that have been can@@ cell@@ ed IN NP IN NP .
however there is NP PP .
and NP CC NP VBD NP PP .
that image remin@@ ded PRP IN NP .
RB NNP , IN NP , NP PP VBD VP .
you probably saw PRP IN NP .
this , all IN NP , is DT ADJP NN NN IN NP .
this happened IN NP .
NP PP PP VBD NP .
JJ the coal man is DT NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
JJ the coal man is VBG NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
this is NP PP .
the largest moun@@ tain@@ top min@@ er is NP PP .
VB S . NP VP , NP , NP , S .
so DT NN IN NP has VBN NP .
this is NP , NP .
at NN we view NP PP IN NP .
that &apos;s why we &apos;ve made it our primary goal to spend NP PP IN NP VP .
the fact is , NP NP .
we think NP VP .
so don JJ NN NN IN NP .
leave DT RP IN NP .
JJ NN -- NP VP .
so let NP VP .
amazing ! DT NN VBZ ADJP .
but that &apos;s NP PP .
and while burning coal is one of the leading causes of NP , NP you see here changes everything .
VP : NP VP .
finally , the positive alternative mes@@ hes with NP CC NP .
america is in NN -- NP , NP , NP .
the thre@@ ad that links NP NP : our addi@@ ction to carbon based NNS , IN NP .
but now there is a b@@ old new solution to get us out IN NP .
re@@ power NN IN NP IN NP .
DT NN S VB NP .
finally , a solution that &apos;s big enough to VB NP .
VB NP . VB PRT NP .
DT VBZ NP .
it &apos;s about VBG NP .
one of the fa@@ st@@ est ways to cut our depen@@ dence on NP SBAR .
JJ NNS IN ADVP . NN , NN , DT JJ NN NN .
new invest@@ ments to VB NP .
VB NP . PRP VBZ NP S .
there is NP SBAR .
if NP VP , go RB . &quot;
we need VP .
VBP NP ADVP .
i want to start out by asking you to think back to WRB NP VP .
as you figured out how to VP CC VP , VP CC VP , you were actually learning how to think and solve NNS IN S .
spa@@ tial reas@@ oning is deeply connected to how we understand NP PP .
so , as NP VP -- i started VP ?
this question was so comp@@ elling that NP VP .
in DT NN , a si@@ ft@@ able is NP NP .
NP VP , NP VP , NP VP , and NP VP .
RBS RB , NP VP , so PP , NP VP .
and si@@ ft@@ ables are NP PP .
and as NP VP , we can VB S .
so , i &apos;m going to start IN NP .
this si@@ ft@@ able is VBN S , and if NP VP , it &apos;ll NN NP NP ; if PRP VBP S it roll@@ s it back@@ wards .
and these inter@@ active portra@@ its are aware IN NP .
so if i put them next IN NP , they get interested .
if NP VP , they notice IN S .
and they can RB VB NP .
one of the interesting impli@@ cations on interaction , we started to realize , was that we could use everyday gest@@ ures on data , like po@@ uring NP NP S .
RB PP , NP VP and NP VP .
if NP VP , we can VB NP ADVP .
there are also some ne@@ at possibilities for education , like language , math and lo@@ gic games where we want to VB NP NP , and view the results immediately .
ADVP NP VP -- NP VP .
here we have a word game that &apos;s kind of like NP PP .
basically , in DT NN you get NP PP , and as NP VP it che@@ cks IN NP .
RB , PP , NP VP , and NP VP .
VBP NP .
ADVP NP VP , and NP VP .
PRP RB VBD NP .
and , NP VP &apos; t have VP .
NP VP and NP VP .
RB RB VBZ NP VP .
that &apos;s NP , ADVP IN NP .
VP , NP SBAR VBD S .
so IN NP , they were RB NNS .
RB , DT VBZ NP .
and we wanted to build DT NN NN IN NP .
and DT VBZ NP , ADVP .
and he can bring new characters into the scene , just by li@@ f@@ ting the si@@ ft@@ ables off the table that have NP VP .
here , he &apos;s VP .
DT NN VBZ VP .
now he &apos;s brought DT NN IN NP .
the orange tra@@ ctor .
good job ! yeah !
so by VP CC VP he can make NP VP !
VBG NP .
hell@@ o !
NP VP , and NP VP .
VB ADVP , NP .
so , the last example NP VP is DT NN NN and live NP SBAR .
NP PP VBZ NP , you get VP .
and you can inje@@ ct these sounds into a sequence that you can assem@@ ble IN NP .
and you inje@@ ct it by just bu@@ mp@@ ing up the sound si@@ ft@@ able IN NP .
there are effects WDT NP VP .
you atta@@ ch PRP IN NP VP .
and NP SBAR .
so let NP VP .
we &apos;ll VP , VP , VP , VP .
now i put DT NN NN IN .
now i &apos;ll VB NP PP .
and ADVP NP VP , so NP VP .
i can speed up the whole sequence by ti@@ l@@ ting NP CC NP .
and now i &apos;ll atta@@ ch the filter to NP PP .
i can re@@ ar@@ range the sequence while NP VP .
ADVP NP VP , but NP VP .
and now , finally , i can fa@@ de the whole sequence out using NP , VP .
VBP NP .
so , as you can see , my passion is for making NP VP .
and today , i had NP , CC NP .
so the thought NP VP is that NP VP .
VBP NP ADVP .
i look forward to talking IN NP .
UH , UH .
i &apos;m happy VP .
UH , RB , WP VBZ VP ?
i &apos;ll VP .
i VBP NP and VBP VP , i started VBG NP because NP ADVP VP .
RB DT VBD NP .
ADVP NP VP and NP ADVP VP , that was PRP .
i think IN NP , NP SBAR .
VP VP CC VP .
there are NP PP .
now RB &apos;s NN NN IN NP NN , NP VP .
and then there are things that have already become NN IN NP IN NP , JJ IN NP .
and DT NN MD VP .
and so because of NP PP , i went del@@ ved IN NP RBR .
RB WHNP ADVP NP ?
most of PRP know NP VP .
NN NN , and ADVP IN NP it &apos;s INTJ , NP VP .
NP ADJP ADVP VP .
NP VP and NP VP .
and it de@@ als IN ADJP IN NP .
and a problem , so not only a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can also just be an access problem that simpli@@ fying things , so any way of looking IN NP , of pos@@ ing a question , asking WRB NP VP or better .
and it was NP VP , but NP VP .
and so now NP VP , and i &apos;d like VP , biology is actually an information science because DT NN NN VBZ NP , i mean real material , and not just cyber@@ ne@@ tic .
but PRP VBZ ADVP NP , and NP VP and ADVP NP VP , NP VP , and NP VP .
NP NP VBP S .
RB NP NP , and NP VP , but PRP VBZ NP PP .
NP VP , EX VBP NP .
but the point is VP .
and then there &apos;s VB HYPH NP HYPH NP - bi@@ o - dot - org , di@@ y bio .
NP VP , DT VBZ NP .
NP VP , and so NP VP .
based IN NP , a scene came IN NP , WHNP S .
DT NN IN NP is IN ADJP , that &apos;s NP , RB NP , NP , NP , WRB NP VP .
NP , NP VBP ADVP S .
here in the bottom left there &apos;s a group in NP , NP it &apos;s called , but they &apos;ve been around for quite some time .
for NP PP .
they look IN NP , and com@@ bine NP PP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
and in this other image at the top i have a lec@@ ture in in NN IN NP .
and that &apos;s , well that &apos;s NP VP .
and what NP VP and S CC S , what do you know , what what do you want VP ?
so , okay , IN NP IN NP , you need NN .
PRP VBP NP , but NP ADVP VP , and NP VP .
CC SBAR , so NP , PP , NP VP .
and our approach was to say , okay , that NP VP .
that &apos;s not necessary IN NP , because NP ADVP VP .
and RB IN NP , NP PP , PP , VBD NP .
so anybody who &apos;s ever had NP VP , has already done this .
NP ADVP VP , and ADVP NP VP .
that &apos;s not supposed to be a jo@@ ke , but here in the image below NP VP , NP SBAR . i &apos;d like to brie@@ fly mention a project .
that here is bio@@ curious , DT NN S , basically DT NN IN NP for IN NP .
and yes , so you can see that NP VP .
but always always with NP NP , IN S .
NP SBAR VBP NP .
and then the fo@@ under of VB HYPH NP HYPH NP - bio do@@ t or@@ g came and said : okay
NP ADVP VP , and NP VP .
and , the focus there was on , so okay , who are we , what do we want , what do we also want what do NP VP ?
and what WP VBP NP and what VBP NP ?
and then we worked on writing up a kind of NN IN NP .
NP VP , NP VP , NP VP .
RB , IN NP , DT ADJP NN VBD VP .
and that was then NP VP , but NP VP .
and then we even tried to bring it back IN NP , but somehow it wasn &apos; t really well received there .
so i think NP VP .
yes , WP NN IN NP do PRP ADVP VP ?
a project i set up myself with the ha@@ ck@@ teri@@ a network in swi@@ tz@@ er@@ land , was one in which we wanted to create NP CC NP .
NP VP , and ADVP NP VP , ADVP , NP VP , so NP VP .
NP ADVP VP , S , CC S , INTJ , NP VP and ADVP NP VP .
you can see DT IN NP .
and then we took apart a d@@ v@@ d bur@@ ner and took out the bur@@ ner the las@@ er and then tried to focus IN NP .
and RB DT NN JJ NN NN , but PRP VBD NP PP .
NP PRN VP , and NP VP .
NP VP , ADVP NP VP , NP VP .
NP ADVP VP , and NP VP .
vis@@ it@@ ors could go IN NP , sit RP IN NP , and put IN NP .
NP VP , and PP , NP VP .
VBD NP .
DT NN IN NP , is DT NP , NP .
this is about NP , VP , so that NP VP .
so when i now that &apos;s what NP , VP , and ADVP NP VP , and then they can say , okay , this hair bel@@ on@@ gs to this person , like that .
and the machines that do NP VP , the ones you buy commer@@ cially , they start at about four thousand euro@@ s at the least .
CC NP VP , but NP VP .
so that NNS QP NN IN NP that NP VP .
and they have NP VP and NP VP and are currently the NP PP .
i think NP VP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
so that was NP PP .
a project NP ADVP VP was DT NN IN NP .
a gene gun is , well , DT NN IN NP .
NP VP , and ADVP NP VP .
RB NP PRP VBP ADVP NP .
but NP VP and NP VP , and DT NN VBD .
then i VBD NP and VBN NP PP .
NP NP VP , PRP VBP PP .
and PP NP VP and ADVP NP VP .
and DT JJ NN IN NP starts IN NP , IN S .
ADVP NP VP , but NP VP .
so that NP VP .
because IN S , NP VP and NP VP .
because if you just read about it in secon@@ dar@@ y liter@@ ature , that &apos;s not the same as when you &apos;ve VBN NP NP or have seen it being done .
and i think NP VP .
and if , IN NP , NP VP , you need NN IN NP .
and and you need to do it and understand it if NP VP .
and this tra@@ des IN NP NP CC NP .
so as a citi@@ zen you are put in a position where you can look IN NP .
and that &apos;s that NP .
those are the people who are at least offi@@ cially regi@@ ster@@ ed on NP , NP .
there NP RRC IN NP worldwide .
and it &apos;s also interesting that NP VP .
that is NP VP .
i know IN NP .
and they are RB NP , NP .
some of them are also regi@@ ster@@ ed together with NP , NP .
and DT VBZ NP .
like i said , NP NP .
and NP , RRC VBD NP , PP .
and that &apos;s become NP , INTJ , NP .
and of course we hope that NP VP .
and NP VP and NP VP .
PRP VBZ RB NP , but NP VP , and SBAR , NP VP .
thanks for VP .
DT VBD NP .
UH , UH .
WRB VBP NP VP ?
this is a question that really moves PRP IN NP , but is RB IN NP IN NP IN NP .
there , the focus is on WHADVP S , so that NP VP .
i think that NP VP .
and this is really incredible , because people actually believe that NP , CC PP NP VP .
RB WP VBP NP ?
i wrote down four key@@ words and would like VP .
arch@@ a@@ ic models are models that we adop@@ ted IN NP .
in@@ trin@@ si@@ c IN NP models is the fact that NP VP .
DT MD VP .
i will cl@@ ari@@ fy DT IN NP , RB , and will attemp@@ t VP .
and the second aspe@@ ct is that SBAR , NP VP .
and the third area spea@@ ks IN NP RB .
we all know that NP VP .
the fourth point is that NP VP .
but how is it with IN NP , WDT VP ?
i would like to prove that IN NP .
how many do@@ ors does the house NP VP have ?
PRP NP VP , but NP VP .
in your mind , you are walking through DT NN WRB NP VP .
that is RB WP NP VP .
you are virtu@@ al@@ is@@ ing DT NN IN NP .
JJ , NN NP NP ?
IN NP , PP , NP VP , but NP VP .
and this this ability VP was NP SBAR , IN S .
they didn NP VP .
and they didn NP VP .
they didn NP VP .
the only thing NP VP was their mind .
and IN NP PRP VBD NP .
PP NP VP , and PP , NP VP .
and that &apos;s why it is so stron@@ g@@ ly ro@@ ot@@ ed IN NP VP .
the interesting thing about DT is that NP VP .
yes , that &apos;s JJ .
the interesting thing about DT is that PP NP VP .
now let &apos;s take NP NP further .
what is NP NP-TMP ?
you will notice that NP VP .
but i &apos;ll come back to NP PP .
DT JJ NN IN NP has RB VBN NP .
NP , NP , NP , VBD ADVP VP .
and today we are RB RB , RB JJ IN NP .
according to NP PP , we still spend QP NP IN NP .
that means that ADVP NP VP , it has spent JJS IN NP VBG NP .
now we think that NP VP .
UH , UH , DT VBZ NP ADVP .
that goes RB NP RB , IN NP .
what is particularly impres@@ sive IN NP is the fact that we &apos;ve VBN NP S .
i brought along an example of NP PP .
they live lived IN NP .
and as NP VP , this is NP SBAR .
and they did this VBG NP .
perhaps you &apos;ve heard of DT already , if NP VP .
PRP VBP NP .
they don NP VP
and the interesting thing about DT is that NP VP .
and IN NP NN VBD NP .
that means NP VP .
and these sounds and this rhyth@@ m de@@ pic@@ ted the ge@@ ology and to@@ po@@ graph@@ y of a region and that of course also made it possible to de@@ frag@@ ment these songs and re@@ ar@@ range them so that NP VP and could also return to the starting point .
why do we no longer sing VP ?
at least not VP .
what WP VP ?
WHNP S VBZ NP .
before this , we were in NP PP .
ADVP NP VP and ADVP NP VP .
and what happened is that we trans@@ fer@@ red NP CC NP IN NP .
IN NP and IN NP .
the con@@ sequence of DT is that NP VP .
virtu@@ ality has suddenly become something alien IN NP
and has nothing more to do IN NP .
bru@@_ce brown , a famous design resear@@_cher at bri@@_gh@@_ton university , went so far as to say that mass media and he means books and images , not tv , the internet et@@_c. which is what we would define as mass media today that these mass media have turned our memor@@_ies to stone and have ero@@_ded our ability to virtu@@_al@@_ise .
let NP VP .
IN NP IN NP .
what has an influence on NP CC NP ?
those are NP PP .
and they will NP VP .
that means that PP , NP VP .
PRP RB RBR VB .
PRP VBP NP .
we no longer imagine DT NN IN NP , but co@@ di@@ fy PRP IN NP .
we &apos;ve got used to things happening IN NP .
and NP VP and NP VP .
what VBZ NP is story@@ telling .
we &apos;re still RB atta@@ ched IN NP IN NP .
NP VP , WP VP ?
NP VP , NP VP and NP VP .
NP VP and PP , NP VP .
but the concep@@ ts of the cy@@ ber age , they are re@@ turning these NP VP .
this is IN NP , IN NP , IN NP .
i &apos;d like VP .
there are NP PP .
so if you think IN NP IN NP , then that &apos;s CD IN NP , and so that means NP VP .
NP VP , NP VP , VBG PP .
and other another example are NP , NP .
those are NP SBAR .
all that calls for NP , NP .
S , NP VP , and NP VP .
NP VP VBP ADVP NP-TMP .
ADVP NP VP , so NP VP .
i brought NP CONJP NP VP .
NP VP , PRP MD VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
and when i say &quot; computer game &quot; , you probably are imag@@ ining a number of person@@ s NP VP or ADVP NP VP .
in DT NN , you imagine NP VP .
this is NP PP .
and it was expres@@ s@@ ly designed to en@@ able NP VP , to re@@ discover DT JJ NN .
and this game conne@@ cts the virtual world , so NP NP , with DT JJ NN .
i &apos;m sorry NP VP .
you can explain DT RB RBR RB later on , as NP VP .
the point of DT NN is that NP VP .
and so i can have DT ADJP NN IN NP because NP VP .
we can take DT NN IN NP .
ah , WP NP VP , sorry , is NP PP .
of course NP VP , that &apos;s obvious .
using NP PP , we can make NP ADJP .
right , i &apos;d like to sum@@ mar@@ ise my my pres@@ entation by stat@@ ing that NP VP , that NP VP and so that NP VP .
VBP NP .
yes , i &apos;m very happy VP .
i was just asked whether NP VP and will talk for PRP .
PRP VBD NP .
i &apos;ll be reve@@ aling what &apos;s inside IN NP in DT NN .
but for RB i &apos;ll just VB PRT NP .
yes , children VBP or MD VP , and RB VBP NP .
NP VP , so ADVP NP VP .
that &apos;s a whole series of things NP VP .
WRB NP VP , they are RB VBN PP .
and that &apos;s VP .
DT NN NN IN NP .
now you &apos;ll be asking yourself why all these designers are starting to conc@@ ern themselves with NP PP .
and now i &apos;ll hold up one of DT JJ NNS , because NP VP , and ADVP NP VP .
and against that background , within the area of natural user interface design , so NP PP VBP PP , i looked into how our tools , or how the computer has suc@@ c@@ essi@@ vely trans@@ formed PRP IN NP IN NP .
so i looked into WRB NP VP .
perhaps we should take DT NN IN NP .
why does this happen IN NP ?
so if we look at DT NN IN NP , sum@@ mar@@ is@@ ed RB RB , we are moving from the third IN NP , or social form .
from the modern IN NP society .
each society is charac@@ ter@@ is@@ ed IN NP .
IN NP EX VBD NP .
that means people related to each other because they spoke NP , NP VP and basically created this tri@@ b@@ al society .
but the primary medium was NP ADJP , and RB JJ .
NP VP , but NP VP .
that was then re@@ placed by NP CC NP .
that was a massive out@@ c@@ ry at the time , because of course it was when the li@@ vely language started to mani@@ fest PRP IN NP , meaning that NP VP .
depen@@ ding on how and when i car@@ ve , a very different kind of co@@ verage comes into being compared to WRB NP VP , so to speak .
but gradu@@ ally the written form VBD NP , and VBD NP .
then the next generation came , which is WRB NP VP .
that &apos;s NP PP IN NP .
NP VP , SBAR , NP VP and NP VP .
and now we &apos;re going into the next generation and the exciting thing about it is that NP ADVP VP and so we &apos;re really in NP PP that NP VP .
of course it totally conf@@ uses us , because PP NP VP .
with its complete transpar@@ ency , which is the new kind of thinking that NP VP say that there &apos;s now horse meat in the las@@ ag@@ ne and not bee@@ f or other phenomen@@ a , because i want to cover that up and not conf@@ ess to it .
and NP , NP , VBP VP .
the exciting thing about this is that when you look IN NP , you can see that NP VP .
but now it &apos;s not IN NP , but IN NP .
we &apos;ve understood that NP VP .
that NP VP .
not , if NP VP and NP VP , the whole thing will no longer work .
that means NP VP .
just like WRB NP VP it &apos;s VP .
NP VP and NP VP .
just like NP VP .
IN NP PRP VBD SBARQ ?
because people often come and ask , can &apos; t NP VP ?
so you have to exam@@ ine WP NP VP , and not only change it so that NP VP .
and to see when something is intui@@ tive of course and how i , as a designer , can have NN IN NP and design things in PDT DT NN that NP VP the things are fun and easy to use .
so even while studying , you deal with the top@@ ic of NP CC NP .
and of course that &apos;s something WRB NP VP and say , okay , let NP VP .
and WRB VBZ NP VP ?
and how do we function , WHADVP NP VP ?
and what does intui@@ tive mean and how do our chan@@ n@@ els of NN NN and how does cognitive process@@ ing work ?
like steve jobs once said : NP VP .
so you really have to go IN NP , if you want VP , and what does that mean fundament@@ ally .
and there you see that , that NP NP , most people think S , CC S .
and VP ?
and just VP ?
information is NP SBAR .
many people use the word but don NP VP .
but i have to have a fundamental understanding , to essentially understand WRB NP VP , WRB NP VP and WRB , PP , NP VP .
and of course WRB NP VP .
NP VP , SBAR , ADVP NP VP , or NP VP .
ADVP NP ADVP , and SBAR , NP VP .
and if NP VP , they &apos;d S .
with the left they &apos;d just intui@@ tively VB NP and RB VB NP DT NN , as NP ADVP VP be NN .
but our perception , WRB NP VP .
for NP PP .
NP VP , S , and CC NP , PP NP VP .
does anybody know WP NP VP ?
VB PRT .
NN NN MD ADVP VP .
here here it &apos;s more likely to turn IN NP .
RB PRP VBZ NP .
a second circle is starting VP .
and IN S , NP ADVP VP and , INTJ , NP VP , and RB RBR NP , NP , NP , NP .
this is called NP PP .
PP NP VP , PRP RB VBP NP PP .
NP PP , NP PP .
they are usually for@@ gotten IN NP .
but it &apos;s an essential compon@@ ent , if NP VP .
NP SBAR VBZ NP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
ADVP NP VP and ADVP NP VP .
that &apos;s JJ .
first you see IN ADVP IN NP .
because NP VP you re@@ co@@ g@@ n@@ ise IN NP .
that means we first project WDT NP VP , then we bring DT IN NP IN NP , and then we say , okay ,
i have this cognitive feedback , you proje@@ cted something NP VP .
and that &apos;s what VP , CC VP .
then it goes back to DT NN , because NP NP and says , now take another look and make sure that SBAR VP .
and ADVP NP VP and NP VP .
so it &apos;s NP CC NP .
i don NP VP .
the same thing WDT NP ADVP VP is now happening .
everybody is now trying to re@@ co@@ g@@ n@@ ise NN IN NP .
i don NP VP .
does NN VB NP S ?
DT NN , RB .
once you &apos;ve seen that that that NP VP , you know PRP .
you &apos;ll never forget it again , because NP VP .
RB PRP VBP NP .
and , WHNP S , NP ADVP RB RB VB NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
and that &apos;s NP PP .
now i know it and project the fact that NP VP .
RB PRP VBP NP .
so these are really exciting processes , which take place accor@@ d@@ ingly IN NP , S , but IN NP .
does anyone know WP NP VP ?
DT JJ NN , UH .
DT VBZ NP .
so it &apos;s always interesting to know IN NP .
if i know something takes three seconds , until NP VP , then i am well capable of bri@@ d@@ ging waiting times , in that NP PP VBD PP .
he will have to process DT IN NP .
ADVP NP VP and , PP , NP VP , IN S .
what VBZ NP ?
UH , NNS .
another RB JJ phenomenon .
it &apos;s the time NP VP .
NP VP , NP , ADVP NP VP .
and NP , RRC .
that &apos;s the period of time NP VP .
that means NP VP .
and NP SBAR PRP VBP NP PP S .
IN NP designers don NP ADVP VP .
so how do humans deal IN NP .
on the one hand there are the practical fun@@ ctions in terms of NP , NP CC NP .
there are indi@@ c@@ ator fun@@ ctions , WRB NP VP .
but there are also symbo@@ lic fun@@ ctions ; why does someone spend NP PP IN NP that you can har@@ dly fit NN IN , even when it &apos;s not very practical ?
we &apos;re RBR IN NP , IN NP , NN SBAR .
going NP SBAR is NN IN NP .
us@@ ability always means how can i reach a goal as soon as possible or how can a user reach a goal in NP PP possible .
that &apos;s WP NP VP .
how can i make NN IN NP ?
can i hand@@ le it directly or do NP VP .
and then it &apos;s JJR JJ or NN JJ .
making NP NP mean PRP ADVP JJR VP .
that &apos;s something NP VP .
and if you look at some of DT NN IN NP , then you &apos;ll understand WRB NP VP a lot more intui@@ tive than classi@@ cal software .
JJ NN NN &apos; t start VP NP PP .
WRB ?
because , as a rule , we can reach our goal NP RBR on NP SBAR .
you need to imagine that in DT JJ NN , if NP VP , then you &apos;d only VB NP S .
that probably doesn &apos; t mean that NP VP , but that NP VP you can do with those four hours .
but WDT NP VP is IN S , VP .
IN S , ADVP NP VP , and NP VP .
then came the next ones , which already worked with NP CC NP , as NP VP .
so no more zer@@ os and ones with NP , CC NP .
NP VP , but PP NP VP .
NP PP VP ADVP VP .
RB , IN NP , PRP VBP NP ADVP .
DT NNS RB DT NN NN .
that NP VP RB that NP VP , and us@@ ability is VBG NP .
and if NP VP inter@@ faces , SBAR , ADVP NP VP .
but that also takes me to the question as to at WDT NP VP ?
if NP VP and ADVP NP VP , when is something really intui@@ tive ?
and that &apos;s for NP , NP is intui@@ tive WRB NP VP .
so appar@@ ently humans don &apos; t like TO VP , they want to make NP ADJP IN NP .
the less NP VP , the more intui@@ tive it is .
and what does that mean IN NP ?
it means that when we can see that NP VP , then i can make use of DT IN NP .
that means NP VP and can so make NP ADJP .
NP VP and ADVP NP VP .
PRP VBZ NP .
NP ADVP VP , and NP VP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
the model already takes shape while NP VP and it &apos;s inter@@ cultural , so NP VP .
NP VP , PRP VBD VP .
i can VP , VP , VP , VP .
and NP , NP , NP .
and that &apos;s IN NP IN NP .
and if NP ADVP VP , and NP VP i can VB NP ADVP or VP CC VP . ,
and then i can VB NP .
i &apos;ll try to VB NP S .
everybody was VBG NP ADVP .
NN : NP VP .
NP VP , ADVP VBP NP NP PP , IN NP .
and suddenly i have NP SBAR .
because the fact that i can gra@@ b hold of NNS like these little pieces , that NP VP and NP VP , is consi@@ der@@ ably more natural than when i am able VP so to speak .
NP VP , and NP VP .
i &apos;d like to rein@@ tro@@ du@@ ce you to NP PP .
fir@@ stly , WRB NP VP is WDT NP-TMP NP VP , right ? and depen@@ ding on whether NP VP , your curi@@ osity is of course a@@ wa@@ ken@@ ed .
and curi@@ osity can &apos; NP VP .
that &apos;s why all the people who are here are actually people who have a characteri@@ stic that can &apos; NP VP .
my obje@@ ctive is to transform this entire discussion about NP , NP into NN .
and RB VBZ CD JJ NN RB .
and that has to do IN NP .
give VB NP .
every day you rele@@ ase + NP VP you have VP .
RB PRP JJ JJ NN VBP NP .
and you wouldn NP VP .
you wouldn NP VP .
we &apos;d only be able to flo@@ at in NP VP .
if , IN NP , NP VP absor@@ b and rele@@ ase NN .
incredibly enough , we we are dealing with something here that would be NP , CC NP .
because NP VP , but NP VP .
DT NN NN VBZ ADJP .
we are depen@@ dent IN NP .
NP ADVP VP and NP ADVP VP .
IN NP RB , NP PP VBD VP .
and we absor@@ b NP PP .
it causes NN IN NP .
and we think NP VP .
RB , IN NP , VP , VP .
VP , VBP NP .
VP , VBP NP .
but DT VBZ RB NP .
NP VP , VBD NP NP PP .
PRP VBZ NP .
if NP VP , then our our entire planet will VB NP ADVP .
that &apos;s why we need to think IN NP IN NP .
and NP VP VBZ NP .
the ground stor@@ es over NP PP .
at the moment we &apos;re VP CC VP , if NP VP .
that means NP VP .
of course we can look IN NP .
and everything is CC NP CC NP .
IN NP , IN NP , NP PP VBZ PP .
and as NP VP , the na@@ pp@@ ies get JJR .
+ that is NP VP .
right ?
one a baby needs IN NP .
we can reduce that by NP PP , but what difference would that make ?
china can make up for NP PP second .
it &apos;s RB JJ .
so the question is , how should we deal IN NP ?
here we have DT NP , IN NP .
i &apos;d like VP .
because with NNS , phosp@@ hor@@ us is rele@@ ased IN NP .
with people , it is rele@@ ased IN NP .
yes .
so humans can &apos; NP VP .
NP VP , NP NP ?
tradition@@ ally , in DT NN IN NP , there is the belief that NP VP .
and if PRP VBP NP NP , people become grab@@ by and ho@@ sti@@ le .
and so you have someone like NP VP .
in NP VP , if NP VP , you &apos;re VP .
on our end we say , the more people you get out of NP , NP .
yes .
the first question is , VBP NP ADVP NP ?
if NP VP , then ants wei@@ gh NP CONJP NP .
NP VP , but PP VP NP .
so ants wei@@ gh more than NP VP .
and because NP VP their energy consumption amo@@ unts IN NP .
NP VP , NP VP , NP VP ?
and SBAR , NP VP , ADJP ?
you can only be climate neu@@ tra@@ l if you don NP VP , you see ?
DT VBZ NP .
have PRP RB VBN NP ?
VBP NP ?
RB CD JJ NN ?
that means NP VP , you see ?
PRP VB ?
there is not one single tree that VBZ NP neu@@ tra@@ l .
RB , JJ ?
RB NP NP IN NP .
there are RB NP PP .
of those have you ever heard of NP PP ?
so all of PRP$ NN amo@@ unts to NP VP .
and then you see that NP VP .
every year we lose NP , SBAR .
and so there are too many IN NP .
RB because IN NP .
that means NP VP .
NP SBAR JJ ?
and that means NP VP .
it certainly makes sense to cause less damage when it comes IN NP .
but where are PRP IN NP ?
NP VP , but NP VP .
we want to be good for society , we want TO VP , but when it comes to NP , NP for NP VP , right ?
CD NNS , NP VP ?
you can only have zero emissions if NP VP .
even if NP VP , you &apos;d RB VB NP .
so you can &apos; NP VP .
we can VB NP ADVP .
we can VB PRT NP .
with DT NN we practice IN NP .
this is a very direct way to get back NNS IN NP .
we do it in china for NN , where we directly take NP VP .
PP NP VP , PRP MD VP ?
and in our western world we were always too stupid VP .
this means that NP VP .
ADVP NP VP and NP VP .
that &apos;s why all western emp@@ ires just kept on exp@@ and@@ ing until NP VP and then they im@@ plo@@ ded .
PRP VB ?
it was different IN NP .
they managed to have DT NN IN NP on NN , as NP VP .
even today , if NP VP , people expect NP VP .
because NP VP .
you were NP VP .
that means NP VP .
the nice thing about that is that when PRP VBP NP , so WRB NP VP , a farmer can VB PP and VB NP PP , VB NP and VB NP .
and the great thing about PRP is that NP VP .
so we don NP VP .
we can support them in VBG NP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
DT NN NN VBZ NP .
and they &apos;re designed IN NP IN S .
that means NP VP .
and NP PP , S , NP PP VBD NP .
NP VP and NP VP .
DT NN JJ NN VB .
that means NP VP .
we can support them in VBG NP .
so we must VB NP ADVP .
and by DT NN , if NP VP the RBS JJ pu@@ ri@@ fication plant is NP PP .
unfortunately RB DT NN IN NP , but perhaps you can VB NP NP .
because NP VP .
and PRP MD VP .
we can see NP VP .
and we can see that NP VP .
in h@@ oll@@ and we &apos;ve been working on NP PP now .
the du@@ tch government has st@@ ated that NP VP .
but PRP VBP NP ADVP .
NP VP , EX VBP NP .
RB VBZ NP , NP .
it consi@@ sts IN NP .
and oil will be able to be re@@ placed IN NP .
but phosp@@ hor@@ us will not be able VP .
that &apos;s WRB NP VP .
and it &apos;s NP VP .
so it &apos;s about NP , RB NP .
in h@@ oll@@ and it &apos;s easier to VB NP , because h@@ oll@@ and built DT NN IN NP .
PRP VB ?
S NP VP , and NP VP .
totally in@@ efficient .
but RB JJ , JJ ?
or VB NP .
DT NN IN NP IN NP IN NP .
whereas .
and that scienti@@ fically speaking , that &apos;s not not exactly cor@@ rect , because because NP VP know how much is k@@ is@@ sed away .
but i can tell you , even IN NP , that NP VP , you see ?
a NP PP are JJ .
so that &apos;s WRB NP VP .
TO VP , what is NP S ?
RB VP , CC VP , how do NP NP ?
imagine NP VP .
right ?
if NP VP and NP VP , we &apos;re VBG S .
JJ , JJ ?
DT NNS JJ .
everything that &apos;s nice IN NP is not efficient .
WRB NP VP ?
yes ?
that means that NP VP .
the whole environmental discussion .
we tell NP , INTJ INTJ , NP VP .
UH , VP VBZ ADVP NP ?
everywhere WRB NP VP , well , you create JJ VBG NN .
but DT JJ NNS .
if NP VP , you have DT NN NN .
to what we &apos;re thinking IN NP .
DT NN VBZ ADJP ADVP .
WRB NP VP , right , every foot@@ print destro@@ ys DT NN .
SBAR NP VP and NP VP .
but if NP VP , every foot@@ print means S .
so it &apos;s about leaving leaving a large foot@@ print , which will turn IN NP .
not NN NN .
we say NN IN NP .
right ?
but if NP VP , how is PRP$ NN ?
WP MD NP VP ?
sustainable .
ADVP NP VP , PRP$ JJ NNS , PRP VBP ?
that &apos;s RB IN NP .
ADVP RB ADJP , VP , VP .
NP PP VBZ NP .
and a pleasure too , if you look IN NP throw out a can of NP PP .
NP VP , PRP VBP .
it &apos;s a type of NP , NP ?
you can show that NP VP .
CC IN NP , UH .
we &apos;ve designed an ice cre@@ am wra@@ pping , for example , which turns IN NP IN NP .
NP VP PRP VBP .
IN NP PRP VBZ VP .
CC NP VP WRB NP VP you &apos;re VP .
that means that PP , NP VP .
RB CD NNS VBP VP .
RB RB RB NN MD VP .
a tv or a was@@ hing machine , DT VBP NP , you don NP VP .
only things WDT VP , such as NP , NP , NP , they have TO VP .
things that are only used NN IN NP .
but today we &apos;re just talking IN NP .
right ?
let NP VP ?
direct adverti@@ sing , and not necessarily for the company pu@@ ma , but to VB NP make these products successful .
because we don JJ NN NP no longer make things free IN NP .
right ?
so if PRP VP CC VP , this is free IN NP , that NP VP .
no , we define WP VP .
RB .
RB RB VB NP .
there &apos;s nothing po@@ is@@ on@@ ous IN NP .
NP SBAR MD VP .
these are the first shoes with WDT NP VP and NP VP , okay ?
it &apos;s all com@@ post@@ able NP PP .
and if NP VP , PRP NN IN NP manage VP .
and NP PP RB VBZ VP .
so you VB S , RB VB NP .
UH , NN , VBP NP VBP NP ADJP ?
because NP VP twice now .
and i &apos;m not so sure NP VP .
RB VB NP NP ADVP .
it is JJ IN .
yes .
that which i just pres@@ ented IN NP .
it &apos;s JJ .
today we can make NNS IN NP IN S .
EX VBP ADVP NP .
RB VBZ NP PP .
NP VP , ADVP , NP VP .
that too , so NP VP .
if NP VP , right ?
VB NP ADVP ?
if IN NP they &apos;re waste .
these na@@ pp@@ ies are RB RB .
in those countries WRB NP VP .
they &apos;re on DT NN NNS , but also RB in NP , NP ?
if NP VP , so NP VP , if NP VP , inside , so NP VP , you &apos;ll be JJ S .
right ?
if NP ADVP VP , VB NP and VB NP S .
that makes DT ADJP IN NP , right IN NP .
so we don NP VP , we can be NN - positive .
it &apos;s about VBG NP .
yes , so TO VP .
right ?
we can VB NP .
we can VB NP ADVP ADVP .
i fo@@ unded an institute with NP PP .
NN , NP VP and NP VP .
ADVP NP ADVP NP , NP , SBAR VBN .
RB RB RBR VP , VP , VP , VP , NP .
does that make NP ADJP ?
VBP NP .
DT NN IN NP .
NN IN NP .
in the descri@@ ption of PRP$ NN , it is written IN S , IN NP , see PRP IN NP , IN NP .
interpre@@ ters are NP PP .
everybody who VBZ NP knows that NP VP , but must also understand NP CC NP , IN IN S .
transl@@ ating from ger@@ man into english can already demand more knowledge , RB if NP IN S if NP VP or even poetry .
what we musi@@ cians do IN NP is very alien to NNS .
as an interpre@@ ter of NP PP i only have the musical notes at first .
now you probably think that NP ADVP VP .
IN NP DT NNS VBP ADJP .
these notes are RB RB JJ CC JJ IN NP , even if NP VP .
because you can &apos; NP VP , you can &apos; NN VB NP , you can &apos; t hear or feel NP PP .
this means that NP VP .
today i &apos;d like to verb@@ ally trans@@ late what i usually trans@@ late IN NP , or interpre@@ t .
so you could VB NP NP .
that &apos;s WRB NP VP .
the so , music fun@@ ctions a lot like NP PP .
the an@@ not@@ ated notes have NP PP .
so it &apos;s not enough to just be able to read notes and find the according NP CC NP .
those would just be the letters NP VP .
you don NP VP .
so you need at least as much time to learn a music musical language as NP VP .
there are different gra@@ des here , for NN if NP VP .
the work of the interpre@@ ter starts off much like NP PP .
once you &apos;ve sel@@ ec@@ ted a piece to play , because you love NP , NP ADVP VP .
you collect NN IN NP .
you read letters , di@@ aries , notes , whether NP VP .
you study NP SBAR .
PRP VBP NP .
the reasons for VBG NP .
ADVP CC NP VBD NP VP ?
WP VP , how were NP CC NP ?
WHNP NP NP .
you imagine the time by looking IN NP or reading NN IN NP .
after a while , you already have a vast reser@@ vo@@ ir of NP VP , and you listen to them regul@@ arly , and so it becomes easier and easier to understand and feel IN NP .
the com@@ pos@@ er increasingly becomes like a friend NP VP .
their desire to VB NP ADVP becomes my own desire to VB NP .
as NP VP , rather , a frame@@ work , i will RB VB NP S .
then i will say , in my own words , what could be written IN NP .
i play to explain WP NP VP .
what they mean to me now , what they meant IN NP IN NP and what they might VB VP .
NP , NP VBZ ADVP VP .
it has to make NN IN NP , otherwise i won &apos; t convince my audience that NP VP .
it always makes for a happy conc@@ ert WRB NP VP , even though NP VP .
NP VP , PRP VBP NP ADVP ADVP .
NP VP , NP VP , NP VP , PP NP VP .
i &apos;m aware of DT NN IN NP , consci@@ ously or un@@ consci@@ ously .
all this VBZ NP and VBZ NP .
NP VP and NP VP .
then the same thing happens as WRB NP VP .
NP VP and NP VP .
NP VP and NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
IN NP , DT NN VBZ NP .
i will never again play as NP VP .
i won NP VP .
i will have JJR NN NN IN NP and so NP VP .
S , NP VP , but NP VP .
PRP VBP NP S .
NP VP NP PP PP .
i was RB RB JJ IN NP unfortunately , so NP VP .
but i had the good fortun@@ e VP , and so i always atten@@ ded his cour@@ ses while NP VP .
i was se@@ vent@@ e@@ en when i took NN IN NP and played NP PP NP , NP .
he asked me what DT NN IN NP was IN NP .
PRP VBZ NP .
and , VP , PRP VBD , NP .
NP VP , oh ?
that must be NP PP .
because IN NP it means NN .
he was QP IN NP .
well , at CD you still have NP , CC NP .
NN , NP VP and NP VP .
it &apos;s exciting every time , because NP VP .
DT NN IN NP . NN VBD NP NP .
it VBZ ADVP NP , but IN NP , IN NP .
NP VP , NP , NP NP VP .
PRP$ JJ NNS IN NP .
a piece of NP SBAR is compar@@ able IN NP .
now i am also older than ch@@ op@@ in WRB NP VP .
he only lived IN NP .
and it &apos;s important to me to always take a look at the notes , even if i think NP VP .
to VB NP , directly with DT NN .
because NP VP .
RB if NP VP .
so how do you start speaking NP PP ?
like i said , NP VP .
RB NP ADVP VP .
you prac@@ tically first learn to read before NP VP .
you learn to find the t@@ ones on the instrument that go IN NP .
when PRP RB VBP NP PP and PP NP VP , RB NP VP , which , together , sound like NN .
ADVP NP VP , DT NN VBZ NP .
NP NP RB VBP PP .
well , so it says NN IN NP , so that VP .
FW , JJ .
the ADJP NNS , NN CC NN , et@@ ce@@ ter@@ a .
most people here have heard IN NP .
but even if NP VP , it still just rema@@ ins NP ADJP .
and it still isn NP NP .
i &apos;m JJ .
i &apos;m surprised that NP ADVP VP .
which is that to make NN IN NP &apos;s own musical action and feeling needs to be there in ad@@ v@@ ance .
which VBZ NP .
a child who has not learned TO VP , because NP ADVP VP , will not start sing@@ ing on its own .
it &apos;s like VP .
it &apos;s necessary to have NP VP .
people who have never sung con@@ sequ@@ ently never directly felt with their own body what it &apos;s like to VB NP .
to form DT NN IN NP own breath .
the music instrument is NP PP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
RB NP PP VBP NP .
NP VP and NP VP .
DT JJ NN IN NP today is not RB JJ RB .
you no longer need to VB NP NP SBAR .
you no longer need VP .
all one &apos;s own NP VP .
sure there are NP SBAR , yes , but what do you do if if NP VP sing ?
then i ask you this , can you not sing , a , because NP VP ?
or b , because NP VP ?
in both cases , it &apos;s not too late to start , to find out whether NP VP , or to learn WRB VP .
because NP VP .
or c , because NP VP .
RB S , WHADJP VBD NP ?
did you get a JJ CC JJ opini@@ on , as NP VP ?
or d , you simply don &apos; t like music and therefore want nothing to to do IN NP .
WDT NP VP , because NP VP .
but perhaps someone just needs to VB NP .
well , but this shows NP , PP , NP VP .
but please don NP VP , i don S .
i can &apos; NP VP .
ADVP NP VP , but NP VP .
because i don &apos; t think NP VP , i don &apos; t know whether NP VP .
so , you don NP VP .
so you don NP VP .
listen consci@@ ously and say whether NP PP or not .
whether NP VP .
say WP NP VP .
with time , you will have dem@@ ands and will want to have NP PP or will even be able to VB NP .
why do i demand IN NP IN S ?
because NP VP is RB VP .
DT NN IN NP will RB VB NP S .
one should eat DT NN WHNP S , not just look IN NP or pass IN NP .
so please listen WRB NP VP .
it is not NP VP .
when a child gro@@ ws up in an environment where the adults ac@@ tively make music or at least ac@@ tively li@@ stens to NN , NP VP , what color is your flo@@ wer ?
can PRP VB NP PP ADVP ?
and the child will play , after thinking IN NP .
and PRP MD VP .
that would be NP PP .
RB NP PP .
and what happens when you play a piece today that was origin@@ ally written NP IN ?
NNS VBP VP .
there was no key@@ board instrument such as NP PP time .
it just hadn NP VP .
i think NP VP .
i can make b@@ ach &apos;s ton@@ al ideas sound on NP PP that NP VP .
of bee@@ tho@@ ven we know that NP VP .
today a modern orche@@ str@@ a can play NP SBAR .
that &apos;s why com@@ pos@@ ers dep@@ end IN NP NP PP .
so that WP NP VP becomes JJ .
and also anything NP VP .
or anything that i imagine because NP VP .
VBP NP .
do you know WP NP VP ?
were PRP RB JJ ?
and WRB VBD NP VP ?
terrible .
i have NP SBAR .
when i turn RP IN NP JJ IN NP , i get this feeling .
something sho@@ ots IN NP .
NP VP , ul@@ f , why do PRP VB NP ?
it will lose NP PP IN NP .
and anyway , you work DT NN less than NP VP .
why do i have VP ?
and then it comes to me straight away , NP VP .
it goes IN NP .
and WRB NP VP , this feeling disappe@@ ars .
our organis@@ m has come up with an exc@@ ell@@ ent method to make un@@ pleas@@ ant feelings like NP ADVP VP .
you can also try it with words like NP CC NP .
i would like to explain DT NN IN NP NN and make NP ADJP , though you &apos;re probably quite familiar IN NP .
the mechan@@ ism comes IN NP .
but VP NP VP , NP VP .
and then they start VBG PRT NP so NP VP .
a lie like that shows you that the li@@ ar NP VP believe WP NP VP .
and it &apos;s easily pro@@ ven that NP VP .
he &apos;s only VBG NP and RB NP .
no , DT NN S is NP SBAR .
you need this lie to keep NP , NP , NP .
this is harder to VP CC VP .
PRP VBP NP .
an an@@ ec@@ do@@ te you might know NNS IN NP .
the span@@ ish NN NN pic@@ as@@ so once pain@@ ted NP PP .
the woman then com@@ pla@@ ined that NP NP VB NP PP .
NN NNS VBP , ADVP VP .
it will start to look more and more IN NP .
at this point and if you &apos;re VP , you &apos;ll recognize WRB JJ NP VP and WHADJP NN NP VP .
because NP VP .
the artist tells you something , and especially this woman , that she can &apos; NP VP .
the artist is con@@ ve@@ ying something NP VP .
then that un@@ pleas@@ ant feeling that NP VP .
here you have this mechan@@ ism , with which we can use DT NN IN NP VP .
and this turns up not only in NN , but also in NP , NP , in in NN , in stories .
perhaps you know NP PP ?
one day this mirror says , yes , there is NP JJR IN NP .
over NP CC NP .
and you also know how much ho@@ sti@@ li@@ ty ar@@ is@@ es from NP PP , for NP VP .
but we should just realize that NP VP .
it &apos;s necessary to always use WP NP VP .
we need this lie here , to keep the de@@ ception up@@ right , without which we wouldn NP VP .
we don &apos; t only have NP PP .
and here there &apos;s this story about NP PP .
she heard about this book by NP NP , NP PP and NP PP .
IN S and IN , yes , there is NP VP .
then she ran ran IN NP and said , sur@@ ely what charles has written is not true .
that NP VP and NP VP .
no , no , that &apos;s not JJ .
and if NP VP , we should VB NP PP .
why do we need VP ?
because NP VP live PRP$ NNS IN NP .
because we want NP VP , that &apos;s unbe@@ ar@@ able for us .
so we can &apos; NP NP .
we have to prevent people from finding IN NP .
to show you WRB ADVP NP VP and to illu@@ strate NP SBAR , WHNP S , i would like to share DT NN IN NP .
DT ADJP NN , IN NP .
PRP$ NN VBD NP NP .
NP-TMP NP VP , NP VP , and NP VP .
an JJ pu@@ pi@@ l .
she li@@ kes NP NP , IN S .
and PRP VBD NP , so WP VBP NP ?
and then he said , well , i &apos;m IN NP .
and because NP VP , i &apos;m JJ PP .
yes , you &apos;ll NP NP IN S , something is not quite right .
i told my wife , whenever a person uses the word because PP , NP VP .
NP VP and ADVP NP VP , SBAR , NP VP .
you sense that NP NP .
NP PP , PRP VBZ RB VP .
he &apos;s interested in VBG NP .
but there are no associ@@ ations to look for WRB NP VP .
ADVP NP NP , SBAR .
that &apos;s WRB NP VP .
and mor@@ e@@ over , you don NP VP WHADVP S .
no , it simply looks a lot better when we show that NP VP .
RB PRP VBP NP .
this this hin@@ t at the fact that NP VP , but that NP VP say that out l@@ oud .
here you have the VP anything about it , and which shapes NNS you know look very different IN NP that NP VP .
in this way certain words come into being that we also use again and again in NP PP .
we know that NP VP .
but we know that SBAR , NP VP .
we can &apos; NP VP .
it is impossible to present such things in NP SBAR .
i &apos;d now like to present to PRP WP NP VP .
according to which lo@@ gic do NP VP , this self - deception , this will@@ ing@@ ness to present NP SBAR is val@@ id in our un@@ conscious minds ?
i would like to present IN NP NP , RB NP to illu@@ strate DT .
NP VP , and NP VP .
i &apos;m talking IN NP .
WP VBZ NP ?
NP VP , NN VBD .
it does not VB NP .
and when you are with people who are fir@@ m@@ ly convinced that NP VP , or , NP VP , S : S , and NP VP , and NP VP , bo@@ und to the earth , ep@@ he@@ mer@@ al , subject to deca@@ y , in@@ significant , dead really .
and now NP VP it &apos;s VBN NP PP , S .
and when NP PP VBZ PRT PP , the human is filled IN NP , IN NP , IN NP .
and then it can VB NP .
that &apos;s how people imagine NP VP .
that NP VP .
we are supposed to view it as something that must be present IN NP .
and if NP VP we feel WHADVP S .
because now you can imple@@ ment NP PP .
you &apos;ll remember NP PP IN NP .
this is a rule of three , which descri@@ bes DT NN IN NP .
DT , IN NP , VBZ NP .
you &apos;ll VBP NP ADVP , but ADVP NP S .
nam@@ ely to lie IN NP .
NP PP VBZ NP .
the first theor@@ em is , NP VP .
NP VP , SBAR , ADVP NP VP .
RB PRP VBP NP .
PRP VBD NP ADVP .
a third theor@@ em which will turn up in people who have a strong atta@@ ch@@ ment to NP PP .
NP VP , NP VP .
RB PRP VBP NP ADVP .
here this lo@@ gic is expres@@ sed IN NP .
PRP VBP NP ADVP .
the first two theor@@ em@@ s are RB JJ .
i can VB NP .
lo@@ gic does not VB NP PP .
NP VP , DT JJ NN VBZ NP .
and if NP VP , then the chan@@ cell@@ or is DT NN .
if NP VP , then the chan@@ cell@@ or is not DT NN .
lo@@ gic does not VB NP PP .
i can VB NP .
WP VP , if NP VP , then it &apos;s JJ .
so WRB NP VP , there is DT NN .
secon@@ dly , if NP VP , then he doesn S .
these things are RB JJ .
and now our de@@ cep@@ tive consciousness immediately senses , i can do NN IN NP .
so it atta@@ ches a third theor@@ em to NP , SBAR and only acts as if NP VP .
because NP VP .
but with this lo@@ gic , which just uses the fact that NP VP , we can save our lie .
so we act as if NP VP .
and we &apos;re very happy IN NP .
we can VB NP PP .
at present at we have a very modern example , which is repe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly DT NN IN NP .
here you have to keep NP , NP , JJ PP .
that has to do with NP VP
century .
ADVP VBD NP VP , and NP VP .
NP NP VBZ NP .
it doesn NP VP .
PRP VBZ NP .
and if NP VP , it will VB .
because it doesn NP VP it should go to JJ .
so it &apos;s right IN NP .
that &apos;s WRB NP VP .
NP PP MD VP .
NN MD VP .
only if NP VP , so as soon as NP VP , then he doesn NP VP .
he &apos;ll auto@@ matically go IN NP .
if you imagine S , you will also quickly have the feeling that NP VP .
and as NP VP , i &apos;ll VB NP PP .
there &apos;s ADVP , NP VP , and ADVP NP VP , there is no free will .
ADVP NP VP : SBAR , ADVP NP VP .
these theor@@ em@@ s are RB JJ CC JJ .
and now the thing NP VP is WP NP VP .
it looks NN IN NP and is RB IN NP .
RB PRP VBP NP ADVP .
really , you &apos;d have to prove , first IN NP , whether NP VP .
but the lo@@ gic of de@@ ception allows us to act as if NP VP have VP .
and now you can simply , if you want VP and RB if NP VP , practice DT NN VP .
practice it WRB NP VP and then say , there are no predic@@ tors .
and VB NP use DT JJ NN IN NP .
you mu@@ st@@ n NP VP .
UH , EX VBP NP .
you &apos;ll immediately hear the following from someone who thinks it &apos;s DT NN IN NP that NP VP , you can &apos; t prove that .
and you &apos;ll VP .
because while you are bus@@ y telling yourself that NP VP , your counter@@ part will be very happy .
he &apos;ll be very happy because NP VP .
because NP VP .
because NP VP .
he &apos;s only interested in keeping himself free of the ne@@ c@@ essi@@ ty to prove that NP VP .
so through NP PP you are experi@@ en@@ cing NP PP .
and if PRP VBP NP , do it , because NP VP .
thank PRP IN NP .
UH , UH .
i took the liber@@ ty NP VP .
she VBZ NP and VBD NP S .
NP VP , and NP VP , i found NP ADJP .
and she said NP VP .
but of course it &apos;s NP PP .
i probably bel@@ ong , VBP NP NP , i think NP VP .
and then i went to NN IN NP because NP VP and NP VP .
RB VBD NP .
NP VP , NP PP VBD ADVP VP .
today they &apos;re VBN NP S .
because NP VP .
but something stupid IN NP , which VBZ NP , that was a to@@ y .
and in NN there was NP JJ .
i &apos;m gr@@ ate@@ ful to the person behind NN NN that he re@@ hab@@ ili@@ t@@ ated that NP VP .
but it wasn &apos; t like NP PP .
IN NP , NP VP and NP VP .
a terror@@ ist place , but it was VP and NP VP .
and yes , DT NN IN WHNP VBZ VP really moves me , because NP VP .
i worked IN NP IN NP , it was based IN NP .
we were NP PP .
if NP VP , you wa@@ sted PRP$ NN IN NP .
he &apos;s wa@@ sting PRP$ NN IN NP .
and NP VP and ADVP NP VP you saw that NP VP , WRB NP VP .
and then i stuck IN NP IN NP and then i became S .
a huge success story , but RB RB PRP VBP NP and ADVP PP , NP VP , and NP VP again , it starts IN NP , that won &apos; t work . i &apos;m talking IN NP .
i &apos;ve brought along a project NP VP .
the ti@@ tle of the pres@@ entation was , how to reach NP JJ energi@@ es .
and we started asking IN NP .
IN NP , DT VBZ NP .
UH , RB VBZ NP .
NP CC NP VBP ADVP .
they have NP PP .
the question is , why don &apos; t NP VP ?
because RB it &apos;s RB not JJ .
if NP VP , the system will VB S .
that &apos;s what i always tell the politicians , when they look IN NP .
PRP ADVP ADVP VP ?
we have NP PP .
that can &apos; NP VP .
but NP VP , NP VP and NP VP .
if we had CD NN IN NP , we &apos;d immediately have the same problems NP VP .
the question is just , calcu@@ late NP VP , the first contact started IN NP , so just work that out .
how big would a battery like NP ADVP VP .
and yes , i &apos;ll NN IN NP .
the conven@@ tional system looks IN NP .
IN NP , IN NP JJ NN IN NP is VBN PP .
that &apos;s equivalent IN NP .
the world &apos;s NP VP .
it goes RB .
you put a box like NP PP .
and that generally looks IN NP .
in PRP , NP VP , two are RB VBN .
yes , that &apos;s what NP SBAR VBZ NP .
we were VBN NP .
and NP CC SBAR is RB NP , CC NP .
our obje@@ ctive was VP , okay ,
the dies@@ el will be NP CC NP , the sun will serve the load in PDT DT NN that NP VP .
and if NP VP , you have VP .
that means that PP NP VP .
of course you can only do that if NP VP .
nobody on this planet has done that IN NP .
NP VP , so NP VP .
people always ask me , WP VBP NP VP ?
that is JJ .
but if NP VP and NP VP , it becomes highly complicated .
and NP VP , S CC S , NP , PP , NP VP and S VP .
that will definitely be an energy car@@ rier which will be NP , NP S , that &apos;s what it will be .
you will then rather have to go to a seas@@ onal reser@@ vo@@ ir and balance out winter to NP CC NP to night .
we just wanted to know what would happen IN NP .
how far would you get IN NP ?
and then we tried out DT JJ NN IN NP .
and NP VP , and NP VP .
DT VBD NP PP .
and RB PRP VBD , INTJ ,
NP VP , ADVP NP VP .
we &apos;re che@@ aper than the dies@@ el system , if DT NN IN NP by NP NP .
and then we started negoti@@ ating IN NP .
what needed VP ?
NP VP , PRP VBD PP .
we were only a group of NP PP , that could that could VB NP .
and RB PRP VBP NP ADVP .
NP VP , DT JJ NN VBZ NP .
the fact that NP VP is due IN NP that NP ADVP VP .
and the power u@@ tili@@ ty , which which DT JJ NN IN NP , said they think NP VP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
and that &apos;s WRB NP VP .
that means we first looked IN NP .
RB PRP VBZ .
naturally it &apos;s IN NP , IN NP .
and fun@@ ni@@ ly enough it was developed IN NP , called NN NN , IN NP , and was RB VBN PP .
it is NP VP .
NP VP and NP VP .
and RB VBN .
we also brought NP PP IN NP , IN NP , IN NP , RB PP .
RB RB S , the c@@ able &apos;s NN NN , VP , RB VP , IN NP .
and RB MD NP VP .
we can also add NP PP IN NP .
NP VP ADVP NP VP , and NP ADVP .
and WP NP VP , the hall was VBN PP , and until NP , NP CC NP , we developed NP SBAR .
so we &apos;re not battery manufac@@ tur@@ ers , but define ourselves as a company that stands between NP CC NP and NP SBAR .
NP VP , and NP VP .
the nice thing about this top@@ ic is that on this island , you can basically anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ te all the problems NP VP .
ADVP NP , NP , SBAR , NP VP , ADVP NP VP .
of course this l@@ ends PRP IN NP .
smart gri@@ ds are NP PP RB .
we can start integr@@ ating electro - mobility on DT NN already , and to ask around whether NP VP .
that means that if NP VP , then you won NP VP .
NP VP , INTJ , NP VP , but NP VP .
and that &apos;s NN IN NP .
that &apos;s WRB NP VP .
if we turn off the dies@@ el , then you will no longer have this ro@@ tat@@ ing mass , which causes NP PP IN NP .
and our european energy grid basically consi@@ sts of NP PP , WRB NP ADVP VP .
NP VP , and SBAR , NP VP , ADVP NP VP , and ADVP NP VP .
DT VBZ NP .
ADVP NN WHNP S .
if NP VP , it takes DT NN .
the sp@@ inning reser@@ ve has ADVP NP VP .
and IN NP PRP MD VP .
if NP VP , then you have VP .
and with this battery we can switch it on and off ADVP IN NP .
so you see WP NP-TMP NP VP .
and so the message is this , we have to make do IN NP , if we actually want to reach our goal of NP , NP , NP , NP , NP , NP ADVP .
and then we have to de@@ cre@@ ase NP SBAR HYPH NP IN NP .
must - run simply means NP VP .
yes , this is NP , NP , CC NP .
and we &apos;re just trying to demon@@ strate that NP VP .
th@@ ank@@ fully many studies are being car@@ ried RP IN NP .
and to this purpose people always come and look at our experiment@@ al equipment on NP , RB NP .
and yes , the discussion always revol@@ ves around WHNP PP NP VP .
and many discus@@ sions i had in the last six years were similar to the discussion NP VP re@@ gar@@ ding photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ics .
you can &apos; NP VP , NP VP , NP VP , NP VP .
we have NP PP .
DT NNS JJ .
and i simply assu@@ me that NP VP .
NP VP , DT VBZ SBAR .
there will be NP PP .
the nice thing is that NP VP .
we &apos;ve been given RP NP VP , ADVP VP .
that will VB NP NP-TMP .
so you &apos;re notic@@ ing NP SBAR , IN NP ADVP , IN NP , one hundred percent rene@@ w@@ able energi@@ es is right .
and WRB NP VP , then it &apos;s IN NP .
up ti@@ ll ADVP NP VP , NP VP , they have their own little network , WDT VP .
NP CC NP , RB PRP VBP NP .
then they &apos;ll only be using what is available IN NP WRB NP VP .
and NP VP and NP VP WHNP S .
and NP VP , and ADVP NP VP , ADVP IN S .
and yes , well , i &apos;d just like to motiv@@ ate you , in the sense that NP VP and have a vision .
and you really have to stay pretty fir@@ m while VP , but NP VP .
VBP NP .
one day , los angeles times colum@@ n@@ ist steve lo@@ pe@@ z was walking along NP PP WRB NP VP .
and the source was NP ADJP , VP .
and i &apos;m VBG NP , because NP VP .
NP VP , NP VP , and ADVP NP VP .
i encoura@@ ge NP PP VP .
i met NNP NNS IN NP , NP IN , IN NP .
he had just heard NP CC RB NP , and came back@@ stage and introduced himself .
NP VP and SBAR , NP VP .
and NP VP , and NP VP .
now , i should mention NP VP .
but as a result now , he is pr@@ one IN NP .
and na@@ than@@ iel was in PDT DT NN IN NP when NP VP -- NP VP , NP VP .
and he was talking IN NP .
CC NP VP , but NP VP .
so , i just started VP .
and i played NP PP .
and as i played , i understood that there was NP VP .
it was as if NP VP .
and na@@ than@@ iel &apos;s man@@ ic ra@@ ge was trans@@ formed into NP , NP CC NP .
and PP , NP VP and NP VP .
and we started talking IN NP , from NP PP and NP , NP , NP , PP , all the way up to NML NN .
and i understood that he not only had NP PP , but he related IN NP IN NP .
he spoke IN NP IN NP WHNP S .
and through playing music and talking about music , this man had trans@@ formed from the par@@ an@@ o@@ id , dist@@ ur@@ bed man that had just come from walking NP PP IN NP .
NN VBZ NP . NN VBZ NP .
and IN NP , NN VBZ NP .
because NP VP .
and that is NP PP .
and i understood that NP VP .
NP VP , and PP , PP , NP VP .
and DT NN IN NP VBZ NP and VBZ NP , VBZ and VBZ NP .
and for na@@ than@@ iel , music brought him back into NP PP .
the re@@ de@@ mp@@ tive power of NN brought him back into NP PP .
and i will always make music with na@@ than@@ iel , whether we &apos;re IN NP or IN NP , because NP VP .
VBP NP .
NNP NNP : VBP NP . thanks .

JJ NN : NP VP .
RB , UH VB NP .
so , i &apos;ve known NP PP IN NP .
i &apos;ve VBD NP .
that first one , it was RBR IN NP .
it was NP : ADJP , NP .
WP DT NN .
even better , it was NP HYPH VP IN NP .
so you could feel good about VBG NP .
i was IN NP .
one day , the head of the company called and asked if NP VP about the farm &apos;s sustain@@ ability .
&quot; absolutely , &quot; NP VP .
here was a company trying VP
for the past 50 years , we &apos;ve been fishing NP NP .
it &apos;s hard to VB NP .
NP PP , NP SBAR -- NP , NP , NP , NP -- NP SBAR .
RB NP NP .
RB , PP CC PP , NP , NP , VBZ VP .
DT NN IN NP : NP VP -- NP VP -- and NP VP . take NN , DT JJ NN .
it &apos;s got NP PP IN NP .
that means NP VP .
not RB JJ .
it doesn NP ADJP RB .
so here , finally , was NP VP .
i wanted to VB NP .
DT NN IN NP , i called NP PP IN NP .
let NP VP .
NP VP , S , NP VP , NP VP . &quot;
&quot; DT NNS RB , IN S . &quot; NP VP , DT NN IN NP gets S , RB S . &quot;

NP VP , what are NP PP ? &quot;
he said he didn NP VP . he would ask around .
well , i got IN NP IN NP ; no one could VB NP NP SBAR .
let NP VP .
NP VP what are NP PP ? &quot;
UH , NP VP , and ADVP NP VP .
i said , VB NP ? &quot;
PRP VBD , NP INTJ , NP , NP , NP , NP , VP . &quot;
NP VP WDT NN IN NP is NN ? &quot;
NN , NP VP , CD NN .
&quot; well , it &apos;s RB CD percent , &quot; NP VP .
NP VP , WP VP ? &quot;
NP VP , and NP VP . &quot;
i fell out IN NP with DT NN .
no , not because NP VP .
PRP RB VBP .
no , i actually fell out IN NP with DT NN because , NP VP , after that conversation , the fish ta@@ sted like NN .
this second fish , it &apos;s NP PP .
it &apos;s NP , NP .
i first ate PRP IN NP IN NP .
a journalist friend had been talking IN NP .
PRP RB RB VB NP PRT .
it came IN NP NP .
the che@@ f had ADJP NP .
UH RB RB .
ama@@ z@@ ingly , it was RB JJ .
who can make a fish taste good after NP VP ?
NP VP , but NP VP .
let NP VP -- actually his name is NN .
and INTJ , NP VP , and NP VP .
PRP VBZ PP NP .
it &apos;s a fish farm in NP PP .
it &apos;s IN NP .
until the 198@@ 0s , the farm was in NP PP .
PRP VBD NP PP .
they did it by VBG NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
well , they couldn NP VP .
and RB , PRP VBD NP .
it killed IN NP .
and RB IN NP , NP PP VBD NP .
WP VBD NP VP ?
they rever@@ sed NP PP .
PRP RB VBD NP .
RB IN S , PRP VBD NP S .
PRP VBD NP .
they created NP : NP : and IN NP RB rever@@ sed DT JJ NN .
DT NN VBZ ADJP .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen NN IN NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
i was RB not ADVP IN NP .
he &apos;s an amazing guy , like three parts charles NP CC NP .
okay ? ADVP NP VP , and NP VP .
here , he &apos;s VP .
now , he &apos;s men@@ tion@@ ing NP PP .
and here , here he sees a grou@@ ping pattern that re@@ minds NP PP .
NP VP , NN VBD NP PP .
i asked him WRB NP VP .
he said , &quot; fish ? i didn &apos; t know NN IN NP .
i &apos;m NP PP . &quot;
and then he &apos;s off , laun@@ ching into more talk about NP CC NP .
and don NP VP , DT VBD ADJP , you know , NP VP , NN IN NP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
and my head was s@@ wo@@ oning IN NP i had the night before .
so i inter@@ rup@@ ted him . i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , what VBZ NP S ? &quot;
he poin@@ ted IN NP .
IN NP VP , NP , NP , NP , NP : NP VP .
but WP VBP NP VP ?
what VBZ NP ? &quot;
well , he goes on to tell me NP VP .
NP , NP , NP , NP VP .
NP VP , PRP VBZ S .
RB VBZ NP .
ever heard of a farm that doesn NP NP ?
NP-TMP , NP VP , and NP VP , NP VP , PP NP VP , WHADVP SQ ? &quot;
at that moment , it was as if NP VP .
and we ro@@ unded DT NN and saw NP : NP .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; NP VP .
JJ NN IN NP , p@@ ink .
PRP VBP NP . &quot;
fe@@ ast@@ ing ? i was RB JJ .
NP VP , NN NN , NP NP ? &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; NP VP .
&quot; NP VP .
well , last year , this property had NP , NP .
it &apos;s become , NP , NP CC NP IN NP . &quot;
NP VP , NN NN , NN JJ NN NP PP NP VP ? &quot;
he sho@@ ok NP , NP .
he said , &quot; NP VP .
DT VBZ NP .
DT NNS VBP NP .
DT NNS VBP NP .
so NP NP , DT JJR DT NN . &quot;
okay , so let NP NP : NP SBAR , and NP SBAR .
DT NN NN , but ADVP DT NN NN .
oh , and by NP , NP , they shouldn NP ADVP VP .
NP PP NP RB , WHADVP S .
every morning , they fly NP IN NP .
and NP-TMP , NP VP .
they do that because NP VP .
no kid@@ ding .
NP VP , so NP VP .
NP VP , and ADVP VBP NP VP ?
do they do DT IN NP ? &quot;
he looked at PRP like NP VP .
NP VP ; NP VP . &quot;
NP VP -- and NP VP ; NP VP , i don NP ADJP .
it &apos;s that NP .
i almost never co@@ ok IN NP .
yet , when i ta@@ sted PRP IN NP IN NP , it ta@@ sted not at DT JJ NN NN .
it ta@@ sted swe@@ et and clean , like NP VP .
i mentioned that IN NP , and NP VP .
he said , &quot; NP VP .
it &apos;s the last defen@@ se before NP VP .
it evolved IN NP . &quot;
and then he ad@@ ded , NP VP . &quot;
ok . a farm that doesn JJ NN NN NP , NP .
and then i realized when he says , &quot; NP SBAR , &quot; NP VP , because NP VP .
it &apos;s NP NP : NP , NP .
and when it works its way through NP CC NP , the water is cle@@ aner than WRB NP VP .
NP VP , PRP VBZ NP .
so , not just a farm that doesn NP NP , RB RB NP SBAR &apos;s literally a water pu@@ ri@@ fication plant -- and not just for those fish , but for you and me as well .
because WRB NP , it du@@ mp@@ s out into the atlan@@ tic .
a drop in the ocean , PRP VBP , but NP VP , and ADVP MD NP , is also in@@ struc@@ tive .
you might say NP VP .
WP NP VP is NP , SBAR .
but IN NP , DT VBZ S .
we &apos;re RB NP , NP NP ; we &apos;re lo@@ vers .
NP VP , NP VP , NP VP , NP VP .
and when you suggest these are the things that will en@@ sure the future of NP , NP , somewhere stands up and says , &quot; hey guy , i love p@@ ink fl@@ amin@@ gos , but how are you going to feed the world ? &quot;
how are you going VP ?
can i be JJ ?
i don NP NP .
no , not because NP ADVP VP .
one billion people will go JJ NN .
QP -- NP , RB NP .
now , i don NP NP IN S .
feed grain to NP , NP has simply asked , &quot; if we &apos;re VP , how terrible could that be ? &quot;
PP , NP VP : NP VP .
we should call it what it is : a business in NP , NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
our bre@@ ad@@ bas@@ ket is thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed today , not because of VBG NP , but because of VBG NP .
not by NP CC NP , but IN NP and RB IN S , but by NP PP .
want VP ?
let NP VP : how are we going VP ?
or RB : SBARQ NP SBAR VBP NP S ?
to VB NP , don &apos; t look at NP PP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
instead , let NP VP .
that &apos;s the one that reli@@ es IN NP .
look to NP , NP .
NP SBAR ; NP SBAR ; NP SBAR ; NP SBAR .
because NP VP , too .
and if PRP VBP VP , they &apos;re a better che@@ f than NP VP .
you know , i &apos;m okay IN NP , because SBAR , NP VP .
VBP NP .
if NP VP , it &apos;s IN S .
so WP NP VP is NP VP .
NP SBAR VBZ NP .
it &apos;s called pi@@ vo@@ t , and with pi@@ vo@@ t WDT NP VP is NP VP -- say , acci@@ dents .
and , right away , i see NP VP .
NP VP , and PP NP VP .
we can step back out again and then re@@ organi@@ ze the data by cause of death , seeing that NP CC NP VBP NP , but not for everyone .
if NP VP and NP VP -- say 40 years CC JJR -- we see that NP VP .
and if NP VP , it &apos;s RB NP PP .
so you get the idea that NP , NP , VP .
and if NP VP , why not VB NP PP ADVP ?
so what we have right here is NP PP illu@@ strated ever produced .
NP VP ; NP VP .
you can go RB IN NP and try DT IN NP .
with pi@@ vo@@ t , you can dri@@ ll IN NP .
you can dri@@ ll IN NP .
you can jump right IN NP .
so i &apos;m looking at this ; i see the ath@@ le@@ tes that have appe@@ ared in NP , NP .
PRP VBP NP , so NP VP and NP VP .
now , if i want VP , i might think , &quot; well , what about taking DT NN IN NP ? &quot;
so i can step RB , and exp@@ and IN NP .
and PRP VBP NP ADVP .
and so you get the idea that when you navi@@ gate over NP NP -- VP , VP , VP -- NP VP , you &apos;re not brow@@ sing .
you &apos;re doing NP SBAR .
NP VP , and NP VP .
so i want to extra@@ po@@ late on NP NP with NP SBAR .
SBAR VP and NP VP .
so the sum@@ mary consi@@ sts of just a little sy@@ no@@ p@@ sis and an ic@@ on to indi@@ cate the top@@ ical area that NP VP .
i &apos;m only showing DT NN NP RB RB .
but even in this limited view , we can do NP PP .
right away , we get a sense of what are the top@@ ical do@@ ma@@ ins that are most popular IN NP .
i &apos;m going VP .
now , having sel@@ ec@@ ted NN , i can now see that NP VP .
so this is really important because NP VP .
it &apos;s only possible to see that insi@@ ght WRB NP VP and look at NP PP .
looking IN NP , i can then dri@@ ll IN NP , VP .
S , NP VP ; NP VP ; NP VP -- NP VP -- and NP VP .
and interest@@ ingly enough , bon@@ o is RB DT JJ NN NN .
so we can go , jump , and take DT NN IN NP .
so you see , we &apos;re navi@@ g@@ ating the web for the first time as if it &apos;s actually a web , not IN NP , but IN NP .
and so i want to VB NP NP .
i &apos;m RB VBG NP ADVP .
so pi@@ vo@@ t , this app@@ lic@@ ation -- NP VP ; S , CC S -- and NP VP .
so i can VP , VP .
now the reason WRB NP VP is because , by NP PP , i can look at NP PP .
so i can dri@@ ll into what i &apos;ve done IN NP .
RB , IN NP , VBZ NP .
and i can sort IN NP NP SBAR .
and , if i want VP , i can sli@@ ce CC NP IN NP -- here , i was doing NP , NP .
and IN NP , PRP MD VP .
NP VP , and PP NP VP .
so right now , in DT NN , we think IN NP .
we talk IN NP .
we talk about dro@@ w@@ ning IN NP .
WP if NP VP ?
if NP VP , we might RB VB NP .
and , instead of dealing RB IN NP , we can te@@ ase out knowledge .
and if NP VP even there &apos;s NN VP .
so IN NP , i thank PRP .
i grew up on NP PP .
in high school , i took a bus to NP NP every day .
and i was always absor@@ bed IN NP , and JJ , in DT NN NN , NP SBAR .
and you know , that curi@@ osity also mani@@ fest@@ ed itself in the fact that WRB NP VP i was RB IN NP , NP CC S .
NP VP , PRP VBD NP .
but it was all about trying to VB NP , VB NP .
and my love of science fi@@ ction actually seemed mir@@ r@@ or@@ ed in DT NN IN NP , because SBAR , NP VP , NP VP , NP VP .
jac@@ ques cou@@ ste@@ au was coming IN NP IN NP .
so , that seemed to res@@ on@@ ate IN NP .
and PRP VBD NP .
PRP MD VP . PRP MD VP .
and i found that because NP VP , i had VP .
you know , we all did , as NP VP , and through NP SBAR , put NN IN NP .
and so , my response to this was to paint , to draw NP , NP , NP , NP , NP .
i was end@@ less@@ ly getting bu@@ sted in NP VP .
NP VP -- NP VP .
and an interesting thing happened : the jac@@ ques NP VP actually got NP ADJP IN S .
i might not really go IN NP -- IN S .
but that was a world NP VP .
so , i decided NP VP .
and the only problem with that was that i lived IN NP IN NP , NP IN NP .
but i didn NP VP .
i pe@@ ster@@ ed my father until NP ADVP VP .
and i actually got cer@@ ti@@ fied in NP PP in NP , NP .
and i didn &apos; t see NP , NP , IN NP , until we moved IN NP .
IN ADVP , PP , NP VP , and NP VP .
and i &apos;ve learned that NP VP .
nature &apos;s imagination is so bo@@ und@@ less compared IN NP .
NP ADVP , IN NP , VP .
and my love aff@@ air with DT NN is JJ , and RB RB JJ as NP ADVP VP .
but when i cho@@ se DT NN IN NP , it was film@@ making .
and that seemed to be the best way to re@@ con@@ ci@@ le this ur@@ ge NP VP .
and NP VP , and RB RB .
so , film@@ making was NP , CC NP .
and of course the stories WDT NP VP were NN NN stories : &quot; ter@@ min@@ ator , &quot; &quot; ali@@ ens &quot; and &quot; the ab@@ y@@ ss . &quot;
and with NN the ab@@ y@@ ss , &quot; i was putting RB NP PP IN NP .
so , you know , VBG NP .
NP JJ VBD PRT PP NP , NP .
and this resul@@ ted in NP , NP .
and even though the film didn &apos; t make any money -- bar@@ ely broke even , i should say -- i wit@@ n@@ essed something amazing , which is that NP , NP , VBD VP .
you know , it &apos;s NP VP .
they were VBG NP S .
and so that got NP ADJP .
and i thought , &quot; wow , this is something that needs to be embra@@ ced IN NP . &quot;
so , with &quot; ter@@ min@@ ator 2 , &quot; which VBD NP , we took that much far@@ ther .
working with NN , we created the liquid metal du@@ de in that film . the success hung in the balance on whether NP VP .
and PRP VBD , and NP VP , and NP VP .
so , drawing a line through those two dots of NN came to , &quot; NP VP , &quot; NP VP .
RB , NP VP , and NP VP .
and NP VP , and NP VP .
and NP ADVP VP and NP VP .
but we found ourselves la@@ g@@ ging in NP CC NP .
so , PRP VBD NP , and NP VP , and NP VP .
and NP VP , and NP VP .
RB , NP VP , and NP VP .
you know , i went and pit@@ ched it to NP PP ro@@ me@@ o and ju@@ lie@@ t &apos; on a ship : &quot; NP VP , passionate film . &quot;
secre@@ tly , what i wanted to do was i wanted to di@@ ve IN NP ti@@ tan@@ ic . &quot;
and that &apos;s WRB NP VP .
and that &apos;s DT NN . now , the NN NN &apos; t know IN .
but i convinced them . i said , &quot; NP VP . we &apos;re going VP .
we &apos;ll be using it in NP PP .
it will VB ADJP . it will VB NP . &quot;
and i talked them into VBG NP .
sounds crazy . but this goes back IN NP about NP VP .
because NP ADVP VP , i find PRP IN NP , VP .
RB NP , RB VP .
now , that VBD NP .
and it took a lot of NN , we had to build NP CC NP .
but , it stru@@ ck me how much NP , NP , VBD PP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
you get IN NP , you go down IN NP WRB NP VP .
and i thought like , &quot; UH . i &apos;m like , living IN NP .
this is RB JJ . &quot;
and so , i really got bitten IN NP .
RB RB , NP , NP -- NP VP . NP VP , NP VP , NP VP .
and it was an experience that hollywood NP VP .
RB , NP VP , NP VP and NP VP . but PRP VBP S .
as PRP VBD NP , i was seeing NNS IN NP and sometimes things WDT NP VP , that actually were not described IN NP IN NP .
so , i was completely s@@ mitten IN NP , and had TO VP .
and so , i actually made NP PP .
PP , S , NP VP , and NP VP . &quot;
and ADVP , NP VP and NP VP .
we went RB IN NP .
we took little bot@@ s WDT NP VP .
and the idea was to go IN and do NP PP .
NN VBD ADVP VP . NP VP , so NP VP .
ADVP , NP VP , ADVP NP VP .
and i &apos;m flying a little robo@@ tic vehicle through NP PP .
WRB NP VP , NN CC NP is IN NP .
i felt like NP VP .
and it was DT ADJP NN IN NP NP VP , because NP VP .
and the set was based IN NP .
RB , PRP VBD NP .
and it really made NP VP .
NP VP , ADVP ADJP .
and it may be a little bit of a gli@@ mp@@ se as to what might be happening some decades out as we start to have NP PP or for other means in many sort of post-@@ human fu@@ tures WDT NP VP .
so , having VBN NP , and really beginning VP where PRP VBD NP .
they live IN NP .
they don NP VP .
and ADVP , NP VP you think S .
at the same time i was getting very interested in space science as well -- again , NP VP , as DT NN .
and i wo@@ und up VP , VP , VP , VP , VP , S .
and this was JJ .
but WP NP VP was VBG NP PP PP .
and taking them down so that they had NP : NP -- taking them down to the v@@ ents , and le@@ tting them see , and take NP CC NP , and so on .
so , here we were VBG NP , but actually VBG NP , and RB VBG NP .
NP VP , NP VP , PP , CC S .
and you know , PP , NP VP .
i learned a lot about science . but i also learned a lot now you think director has got to be NP , NP , NP PP , and NP PP .
i didn &apos; t really learn about NN until NP VP .
because i had VP what am i doing out here ?
why am i doing DT ? what do i get IN IN NP ? &quot;
we don NP VP .
we bar@@ ely break even . there is DT NN IN NP .
people sort of think NP VP .
VP , VBD NP PP .
DT NN , DT NN , DT NN . WP VBP NP VP ?
NP VP -- and NP VP .
because NP VP , RB at NP PP , three months at DT NN .
and in that bon@@ d , you realize that the most important thing is the respect that NP VP and that NP VP , that you &apos;ve done a task WDT NP VP .
when NP VP and NP VP , VBP SBAR NP , NP , the JJ HYPH NN aspe@@ cts of VP , &quot; NP VP . it &apos;s that NP VP .
VBZ NP , creates DT NN IN NP .
RB , SBAR NP VP , and NP VP .
and PRP RB VBD NP .
so , here i was RB IN NP , IN NP , VP , &quot; coming up with NP SBAR exist before .
tremend@@ ously exciting .
tremend@@ ously challen@@ ging .
and we became DT NN , IN NP .
and it completely changed WRB NP VP .
so , NP VP , you VBD PRT NP and VB NP PP . &quot;
to me , it was more of a fundamental way of doing NP , NP NP , IN S .
so , what can we syn@@ thes@@ ize IN IN NP ?
S , WP VBP NP VP ?
well , i think NP VP .
it &apos;s NP SBAR .
imagination is NP SBAR .
and the respect of your team is more important than NP PP .
i have young film@@ makers come up IN NP and VP . &quot;
and i say , &quot; VB NP put NNS IN NP .
other people will do DT IN NP -- don S , don JJ NN NN IN NP , and take NNS . &quot;
NP VP : NP VP . &quot;
but failure has to be an option IN NP and IN NP , because PRP VBZ NP .
and no important en@@ dea@@ vor WDT VP was done IN NP .
you have to be willing to VB NP .
so , that &apos;s the thought NP VP , is that in WDT NP VP , failure is an option , but fear is not . thank you .
i &apos;m going to talk NN IN NP .
and that might seem a bit JJ because NP VP .
but energy and climate are extremely important to these people -- in fact , more important than IN NP on the planet .
the climate getting worse means that NP VP will change in NNS that NP ADVP VP .
and NP VP , NP VP , S .
so , the climate changes will be terrible IN NP .
also , the price of NN is very important IN NP .
in NN , if NP VP , by far you would VB NP .
RB , NP PP VBZ VP .
really advanced civilization is based IN NP .
NP VP , and , ADVP PP NP VP , and NP VP .
and so , we &apos;re IN NP IN NP .
but , as NP VP go IN S .
NP VP , and NP VP .
IN S , NP VP , and ADVP NP VP .
now , the ex@@ act amount of how you map from a certain increase of NN to what NP VP and SBAR , NP VP , but not very much .
and there &apos;s certainly un@@ certain@@ ty about how bad NP VP , but NP VP .
i asked NP : VP ?
can VB NP we just cut it in NP CC NP ?
and the answer is that until NP VP , the temperature will VB S .
and IN DT VBZ NP .
NP VP , and NP VP . &quot;
this is something that has to get IN NP .
now , we put RP NP PP , IN NP .
SBAR , NP VP ; PP , NP VP .
it &apos;s NP PP IN NP .
and , somehow , we have to make NP SBAR .
PRP VBZ VP .
NP VP , so NP VP .
NP VP : ADVP , NP VP .
so , let NP VP .
RB , NP PP VBZ VP .
now that &apos;s RB IN NP , but let NP VP .
first , we &apos;ve VBD NP .
DT NN NN VBZ NP .
that &apos;s head@@ ed RP IN NP .
ADVP , SBAR , NP VP , but ADVP NP VP .
the second factor is the services NP VP .
this en@@ com@@ pas@@ ses NP : NP .
NP VP : S VP .
and it &apos;s NP PP .
IN NP , PRP RB MD VP , but NP-TMP , NP , PP , VP , and ADVP , PP , NP VP .
ADVP NP VP : VBP NP VP .
and , in fact , these kids don &apos; t , so NP VP .
RB , NP , NP , NP , RB RB PRP VBP NP .
we have NP SBAR .
IN NP , IN NP , NP PP VBP NP PRT PP .
there are NP PP .
and so , over@@ all here , if we &apos;re optimi@@ stic , we may get a redu@@ ction of DT NN IN NP to even , RB , NP PP .
but IN NP ADVP , NP VP , ADVP , NP VP .
RB VP -- NP VP -- and NP VP .
and so the question is : can you actually get DT IN NP ?
if NP VP , no .
if NP VP , no .
almost every way NP VP , puts out co2 .
and so , WP NP VP , is VB NP .
and RB , PRP VBP NP .
now , WRB NP VP , NN S mean NP SBAR .
DT NN VBZ NP . DT JJ NN VBZ NP .
NP CC NP VBP NP .
so , the people here have partici@@ p@@ ated IN NP .
usually , we don NP VP .
RB , NP ADVP VP , and NP VP .
this is a case where we actually have to drive IN NP and get NP PP .
now , i thought , &quot; how could PRP RB VB NP ?
is there some kind of natural illu@@ stration , some demon@@ stration that would VB NP NP ADVP ? &quot;
NP VP , and ADVP NP VP .
NP ADVP VP , NP VP , NP VP .
RB , IN NP , NP SBAR VBZ NP .
i decided that VBG NP would VB NP PP .
RB RB PRP VBP NP .
NP VP ; PP , NP VP .
now , there &apos;s NP PP IN NP , but they don NP ADVP VP .
NP VP , and , SBAR NP VP , NP ADVP VP .
i &apos;ve left RP NP , NP , NP , NP .
those may make some contribu@@ tion , and if PRP MD VP , so much the better , but my key point here is that NP VP , and we can &apos; NP VP IN S .
let NP VP .
WHNP S , VBZ SBAR , but NP VP , and NP VP .
ADVP NP VP , but NP VP .
who &apos;s VP ?
who &apos;s going to guar@@ an@@ tee something that is literally NP JJR IN NP NP VP ?
this is NP PP .
so DT VBZ NP .
RB MD VP .
NP ADVP VP : NP VP ; NP VP .
and then what do you do IN NP ?
and , IN S , NP VP .
NP SBAR , MD VP .
NP PP , PRP VBP VP .
these are what people often re@@ fer to IN NP .
and they actually -- although it &apos;s great NP VP -- they have some dis@@ advan@@ tages .
one is that NP VP .
NP VP , so NP VP .
RB , DT VBP NP .
NP NP DT NN , PRP VBD NP NP-TMP .
and so , if NP VP , you have VP .
ADVP PRN NP VP , but NP VP .
and NP NP .
and , to dimension@@ alize this , i went through and looked at all the types of bat@@ ter@@ ies that get made -- IN NP , IN NP , IN NP , IN NP , IN NP -- and compared that PP NP VP , and what i found is that all the bat@@ ter@@ ies we make now could store less than 10 minutes of all the energy .
and RB , IN NP , PRP VBP NP ADVP , NP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
now , this shows up when you try to get the inter@@ mitt@@ ent source to VP , VP , NP .
if you &apos;re coun@@ ting IN NP IN NP , you need an incredible mira@@ cle battery .
now , WRB NP VP ?
is it a manhattan project ? what &apos;s NP SBAR ?
well , we need lots of companies working on NP , NP .
IN NP , PRP VBP NP .
and NP PP , you VBP NP PP and VB , VP . &quot; NP VP .
and , NP VP , here IN NP , we have NP SBAR .
bill gro@@ ss has several companies , including NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
NP CC NP RB VBP VP .
there are NP : NP .
and innovation really stopped in DT NN quite NP IN , so NP VP .
the idea of ter@@ ra@@ power is that , instead of VP , &quot; let NP VP . &quot;
it is kind IN NP .
PP , NP VP , but NP VP .
and , IN S , NP VP .
NP ADVP VP , and NP VP .
so , instead of wor@@ rying IN NP , you just take that . it &apos;s a great thing .
it brea@@ th@@ es this ur@@ ani@@ um as NP VP .
you can see NP VP , ADVP VP .
IN NP , DT RB VBZ NP .
i &apos;ve got NP PP .
NP VP , so NP VP .
that would power the u.s. for NP PP .
and , simply by NP PP , you &apos;d S .
ADVP PRN NP VP , but NP VP .
RB VB NP VP ?
WP MD NP VP ?
well , let NP VP .
for 20@@ 50 , you &apos;ve heard NP VP .
that really is very important , that NP VP .
and that NP VP hopefully we will VB VP .
so , to get IN NP , will have had VP .
RB , NP VP , SINV and NP VP ?
DT NNS RB JJ .
that &apos;s NP PP .
so , bac@@ king RP IN NP the 20@@ 20 report card look like ?
well , again , it should VB NP .
we should go IN NP VP : the less NP VP , the less the temperature .
but in some ways , the grade we get there , doing things that don &apos; t get PRP NP IN NP , is only equ@@ ally , or maybe even slightly less , important than the other , which is DT NN IN NP .
NP , NP VP , and NP VP .
RB NP NP IN NP .
the al gore NN , &quot; NP CC NP IN NP . &quot;
they really go through PRP and create a frame@@ work that NP VP .
there NP NP WHNP S .
RB DT VBZ NP .
it &apos;s NP SBAR .
if PRP VBD NP NP -- NP VP , NP VP , or NP VP -- this is DT NN S .
this is NP PP .
IN S , NP VP , and NP VP .
so , what do we have VP ?
what am i appe@@ aling IN NP VP ?
we need to go IN NP .
WRB NP VP , they shouldn NP ADVP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
we do need NP : NP -- NP SBAR .
we need VP .
we need to have NP VP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
VBP NP .
VBP NP .
VBP NP . VBP NP .
VBP NP . S , ADVP IN NP , MD NP VP ?
bi@@ l gates : to actually do the software , buy the super@@ computer , hi@@ re all the great scientists , which NP VP , NP VP , and ADVP SBAR NP VP .
NP VP ; VP .
once you get NP VP , IN S .
and so , to understand it right , this invol@@ ves building deep into DT NN almost IN NP , and then the process starts IN NP and NP RB works RP ?
b@@ g : that &apos;s right . today , you &apos;re always re@@ fu@@ el@@ ing the re@@ actor , so you have NNS IN NP IN NP .
so , if you have very cheap fuel that you can put 60 years in -- just think IN NP IN NP -- put it down and not have those same comple@@ xi@@ ties .
and NP VP , and ADVP NP VP .
it &apos;s NP SBAR .
b@@ g : yeah . well , what happens with the waste , you can let it sit RB -- RB NP JJR NN IN NP -- ADVP NP VP and burn that .
and we start off actually by taking the waste that exists today , that NP VP -- that NP VP .
ADVP , NP VP , and NP VP .
NP VP , PRP VBP VP .
where is NP PP ?
b@@ g : INTJ , NP NP VP -- NP VP .
RB PRP VBP ADJP . NP VP , DT ADJP VBP VP .
this is NP PP .
it &apos;s an important ad@@ v@@ ance , but it &apos;s IN NP , and NP PP VBP VP , so NP SBAR VBZ NP .
so , in your mind , ti@@ mes@@ c@@ ale and li@@ ke@@ li@@ hood of actually taking something like NP VP ?
b@@ g : INTJ , NP VP -- PP , NP VP .
that &apos;s sort of the de@@ ad@@ line that the environmental models have shown us that NP VP .
and , NP VP -- could RB VB NP .
and NP VP -- NP VP , IN S .
and it &apos;s best if multiple succe@@ ed , because then you could use NP PP .
PRP RB VBP NP S .
in NP PP , is this the biggest WDT NP VP ?
NNP : NP VP .
NP VP , but NP ADVP VP .
IN NP , EX VBP NP .
NP VP , S , but NP VP .
ADVP NP , but ADVP NP VP .
and ADVP , NP VP , but NP VP -- if NP VP -- DT NN CC NN , NP , PP , is RB IN NP .
IN NP NP , RRC ?
do we have to start taking emergen@@ cy meas@@ ures to try and keep NP PP stable ?
b@@ g : SBAR , NP VP , and NP VP ? you may VB NP .
there is a line of NP PP ge@@ o@@ engineering , which VBP NP .
RB , IN NP RB NP .
you hope NP VP .
some people say you shouldn &apos; t even work on the in@@ sur@@ ance policy because it might make NP ADJP , that you &apos;ll keep eating because NP VP .
NP VP , or NP VP ?
climate skep@@ tics : if you had NP VP , how might you per@@ su@@ ade them that NP VP ?
b@@ g : well , unfortunately , the skep@@ tics come IN NP .
the ones who VBP NP are very few .
are they saying that NP VP ?
NP VP VBZ NP PP .
the main problem NP VP , it &apos;s kind of like NNS .
NP VP , and NP VP .
and ADVP , SBAR , NP VP , and NP VP . &quot;
the fact is NP VP .
but NP ADVP VP , NP VP , NP ADVP VP VP , but PRP VBP S . &quot;
and ADVP , NP VP and ADVP , NP VP NNS S .
b@@ g : INTJ , NP VP -- NP VP .
it shouldn NP VP .
NP NP VP , and NP PRN VP .
unless NP VP and NP VP and NP VP , i believe NP VP .
if the trade - off NP VP is , NP VP , &quot; then the rich can afford that .
NP VP , NP PP RB MD VP .
the disaster is IN NP .
and RB NN VBZ VP .
his sh@@ ti@@ ck now is , NP SBAR ; d getting NP VP ? &quot;
he &apos;s still , because of his earlier stuff , still associated with the skep@@ tic camp , but he &apos;s realized that NP NP , and so , he &apos;s making NP CC NP ; NN NN .
and so there is NP PP .
NP : NP , NP VP .
well bill , i sus@@ pe@@ ct NP VP . thank you so much .
NNP : VBP NP .
several years ago RB IN NP , peter sk@@ ill@@ man introduced NP VP .
and the idea &apos;s pretty simple : teams of four have to build the t@@ all@@ est free - standing structure out of 20 sti@@ cks of NP , NP , NP CC NP .
the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low has to be IN NP .
and , though it seems really simple , it &apos;s actually pretty hard because NP VP .
and ADVP , NP VP , and NP VP .
and PRP VBD NP .
and PP , NP VP , and NP VP .
so , normally , most people begin by ori@@ enting PRP IN NP .
NP VP , NP VP , NP NP .
ADVP NP VP , NP VP and NP VP .
they spend the majority of NP VP .
and then finally , just as they &apos;re running IN NP ! -- they ad@@ mi@@ re their work .
but what really happens , most of the time , is that the &quot; ta - da &quot; turns IN NP u@@ h-@@ oh , &quot; because NP PP VBZ NP S .
so EX VBP NP u@@ h-@@ oh &quot; moments IN NP , and IN NP are JJ NNS IN NP .
NP VP , NP VP , NP VP and NP VP .
and of course there are teams that have a lot more &quot; IN HYPH NP , and IN NP are NP PP .
and it &apos;s RB JJ .
SBAR NP VP , but NP VP .
so the question NP VP is : WHADVP SQ why ? what is PRP IN NP ?
and peter li@@ kes to say that NP VP . right ?
they don NP VP .
but RB VBZ NP ADVP .
and the reason is that NP VP ?
and then they ex@@ ec@@ ute IN NP .
and then what happens is , when PRP VBD NP PP , NP VP and WP VP ?
PRP VBZ NP .
NN JJ ? right .
SBAR VP , and NP VP .
designers recognize NP PP IN NP .
and with each version , kids get inst@@ ant feedback about WHNP S and NP NP .
ADVP NP VP , but VP .
ADVP NP VP ; NP NP ; NP ADJP .
who VBZ NP ?
NNS CC NNS , RB .
thirty - nine in@@ ches is the t@@ all@@ est structure NP VP .
and why is it ? because PRP VBP NP and self - reinforcing ge@@ om@@ et@@ ri@@ cal patterns are the key to VP .
so NP , NP , CC RB VBZ SBAR .
IN S VB NP . IN NP , PRP VBP ADJP .
it &apos;s JJ . PRP VBP , you look RB , S , &quot; NP VP . &quot;
PRP MD ADVP VP . and WRB VBZ NP ?
because NP VP .
NP VP , PRP VBP NP .
and any team who VP CC VP will signific@@ antly improve NP VP .
NP CC NP VBP NP .
if NP VP , you &apos;ll VB ADVP NP .
and PRP VBD NP S .
i thought , let NNS IN NP , once .
so i off@@ ered NP PP IN NP .
so what do you think happened IN NP ?
WP VBD NP ?
here &apos;s WP VP : not one team had DT NN NN .
IN S , VB , NP , they would VB VP .
RB , NP NP ? DT JJ NNS VBP NP .
we did DT NN RB IN NP .
what do you think VP ?
so now they understand NP PP .
so the same team went from being the very worst to being IN NP .
they produced the t@@ all@@ est structures in NP PP .
so there &apos;s NP PP IN NP .
so , you might ask : why would NN ADVP VBP NP S ?
and the reason is , i help create digital tools and processes to help teams build NP CC NP CC NP .
and what the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge does is it helps NP VP .
because , frank@@ ly , every project has NP , NP ?
the challenge provi@@ des NP , NP .
and so , this is DT NN IN NP , IN NP .
and those of you who are interested may want to go IN NP .
it &apos;s a blog WDT NP VP .
there &apos;s NN - IN HYPH NP on this .
there are crazy examples from around NP PP .
there NP NP WHNP S .
and the fundamental lesson , NP VP , is that NP ADVP VP .
it dem@@ ands that NP VP , and that NP VP .
and sometimes , a little prototyp@@ e of this experience is all that NP VP .
and that can VB NP .
VBP NP ADVP .
let NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
and NN IN NP has VP .
and you can go ADVP , NP VP ; NP VP .
and i wonder what NP VP and NP ADVP VP .
i don &apos; t know . they want to go back before there were NP CC NP . &quot;
i don NP VP .
i &apos;m convinced that NP VP .
and i understand IN .
NP VP , PRP VBP S .
NP VP , and NP VP .
NP VP , NP VP , NP VP .
ADVP NP VP , and NP VP .
this is the greatest time there &apos;s ever been IN NP IN NP ...
RB NP VP .
my great - grandparents died , all of them , by the time NP VP .
my grand@@ parents pus@@ hed DT NN IN NP .
my parents are clo@@ sing RP IN NP .
so there better be NP PP .
but it &apos;s not RB about NP PP , because NP VP .
a kid born in new del@@ hi today can expect to live as long as NP VP .
think IN NP , it &apos;s an incredible fact .
and WRB VBZ NP ADJP ?
small@@ po@@ x . small@@ po@@ x killed NP PP IN NP .
it res@@ ha@@ ped DT NN IN NP that NP ADVP VP .
PRP VBZ VP . PRP VBZ VP .
PRP VBD NP . pu@@ ff .
in the rich world , diseases that thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed NP PP RB NP PP exist , har@@ dly .
NN , NN , NN ...
does anyone even know WP NP VP ?
NP , NP , NP , DT VBP NP .
and IN NP , NP : VP : VBZ NP .
so DT VBZ NP .
RB , NP VP , and NP VP .
and one of them is that despite all our ac@@ compli@@ sh@@ ments , a billion people go to bed hun@@ gry in NP NP .
DT NN VBZ S , and NP VP , and NP VP .
and ADVP IN S NP NP .
NP , NP , NP , NP , NP : S , CC S .
so the question is : can PRP VB NP ? and i think NP VP .
i think NP VP .
i think NP VP .
NP ADVP VP , NP PP .
but RB VBZ NP : NP VP . RB .
and we &apos;ve also never been IN NP VP IN NP .
we &apos;re on NP PP , and yet i actually think NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
not even the truth will set NP ADJP .
and , listen , everyone &apos;s VP ; NP VP .
but you know WP NP VP ?
you &apos;re not enti@@ t@@ led IN NP . sorry , you &apos;re not .
and DT VBD NP ADVP S .
about NP IN , i wrote DT NN IN NP . a little story .
and i was ama@@ zed to find NP : NP .
NP VP , so NP ADVP VP : NP VP and NP VP .
and RB IN NP , PRP VBD NP PP .
JJ NN , RB JJR .
NNS VBD VP .
ADVP NP VP , and NP VP , was NP PP ground .
but , NP VP , i do WHNP S . PRP VBD NP , i moved RB .
NP VP , PRP VBP NP .
NP VP , NP VP , NP VP . PRP VBZ ADJP .
but DT NNS VBD NP , and NP VP , and ADVP NP VP .
and that &apos;s because those fan@@ a@@ tics that were driving NP NP ADVP NP ADVP .
they were NP , NP , NP .
they were exactly like NP PP .
and PRP RB VBD NP ADVP .
but ADVP NP VP , NP VP , VP .
we &apos;re at a point in this world where we don NP VP .
we talk IN NP RB .
we talk IN NP IN NP . &quot;
okay , there are NP PP , and i think NP VP .
we &apos;ve lost faith IN NP , IN NP , and RB IN NP PRP , and there &apos;s DT NN S .
NP VP and NP VP .
NN , JJ , DT NN , NN , NP PP , VBG NP .
NP VP , PRP MD VP .
there are questions and problems with the people NP VP .
ask NP , NP , NP .
don NP VP .
but here &apos;s DT NN : SBAR , NP VP , and NP VP .
and the reason WDT NP VP is because NP VP .
about 12 years ago , there was a story published , a horri@@ ble story , that lin@@ ked DT NN IN NP to NP , NP CC NP .
very sc@@ ary .
tons of studies were done to see if NP VP .
NP VP ; NP VP .
the data came RB .
NP VP , and NP VP .
it doesn &apos; t matter . it doesn &apos; t matter because NP VP , we believe WP NP VP , WP NP VP , WP VBZ NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
but PRP VBP SBAR ?
NP PP VBZ VP .
dis@@ a@@ str@@ ous because RB VBZ NP : the united states is one of NP PP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
it &apos;s JJ .
what kind of a thing happened that NP VP ?
now , i understand PRP . i do VB NP .
RB , did NN VB NP ADVP ?
has NP PP ADVP VBN NP ?
NN JJ NN VB ADVP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
that &apos;s NP PP -- NP NP .
but IN S , PRP MD VP , and NP VP and NP VP . &quot;
and they can do it because NP VP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
and it &apos;s something NP VP , and NP VP .
this guy was NP , NP .
he took CD IN NP away IN NP .
DT NN , DT NN . NNP -- NP , VP .
DT NN IN NP , not so much .
PRP$ NN VBZ NP .
he just developed a ro@@ ta@@ virus v@@ acc@@ ine with NP PP .
it &apos;ll IN NP IN NP .
RB JJ , JJ ?
well , it &apos;s good , except that NN VBZ S and says WRB JJ NP VP and that NP VP .
and he actually says NP NP .
RB , NN VBZ NP .
when paul spea@@ ks in DT JJ NN , he can &apos; t te@@ sti@@ fy IN NP .
he gets called at home because people like to tell him that NP VP .
and WRB ? because NP VP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
PRP VBP NP NP . and DT VBZ S .
we have NNS IN NP now .
and NP VP , and ADVP NP VP .
and they &apos;re not just going to die IN NP .
what about NNP ? let NP VP . why not ?
a college class@@ mate of mine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said she thought NP VP .
DT NN VBZ ADVP VP .
she wasn &apos; t going to vac@@ cin@@ ate her kid against NP , NP .
fine .
why ? because NP VP have NN . and you know WHNP ?
we didn NP VP .
today , i don NP VP , maybe a guy got IN NP DT NN , and he &apos;s VP , right now he &apos;s over NN .
and NP VP , NP VP , and NP VP , and PRP VBZ S .
and he doesn NP VP .
that &apos;s the planet NP VP . don JJ NN VBP NP isn &apos; t .
now , we love to VB NP PP . we love to VB NP .
NN VB NP NP-TMP ?
e@@ chin@@ ac@@ e@@ a , a little anti@@ o@@ xi@@ d@@ ant to get NP VP .
i know NP VP .
PRP VBP NP , and NP VP , and NP VP .
DT NN VBZ NP NP-TMP .
PRP VBP NP . PRP RB RB VB NP PP .
NP VP , PRP VBP S ?
i &apos;m RB IN NP .
dark ur@@ ine . dark .
why do PRP VBP NP ? why do PRP VBP NP ?
well , i think NP VP , we hate big phar@@ ma .
we hate JJ NN . we don NP NP .
and PRP VBP NP : our NN NN system su@@ cks .
it &apos;s cru@@ el IN NP .
it &apos;s absolutely ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ingly cold and soul - bending to DT IN NP WP VP .
so NP VP , and where do PRP VB ?
we lea@@ p IN NP .
DT NNS JJ . PRP VBP NP .
but , you know , it &apos;s really a serious thing because NP VP , and NP VP .
and i have NP PP RB .
NP NP VP -- NP VP .
and you know WP ? when NP VP , NP VP , and NP VP , &quot; WP VBP NP VP ? let NNS VB SBAR .
it makes NP VP . &quot;
and PRP VBP SBAR ? PRP VBP ADJP .
because i don &apos; t care if PRP VBZ NP , &quot; h@@ mm , i &apos;m not going to take NP PP IN NP .
when you start down the road where belief and magic replace evidence and science , you end up in a place you don NP VP .
you end up in NP ADVP .
he killed 40@@ 0,000 of his people by insi@@ sting that NP VP .
hundreds of thousands of need@@ less dea@@ ths in NP SBAR .
please , don NP VP .
EX VBP . RB RB VBP .
now , the most min@@ d@@ less epidemic we &apos;re in NP PP is this ab@@ sur@@ d battle between pro@@ pon@@ ents of NP CC NP .
PRP VBZ NP . PRP VBZ S .
it &apos;s NP PP , IN NP .
NP VP , PRP VBZ RB NP .
every single thing we eat , NP , NP VP has been modi@@ fied by NN .
NP VP , EX VBZ NP PP .
RB NP NP .
RB NP NP . PRP VBD S .
we made PRP IN NP .
and NP VP , and NP VP .
we got rid IN NP .
RB PRP MD VP -- and NP VP -- but NP VP , and NP VP .
you don NP VP ?
i have VP , i don NP VP .
we object IN NP .
why do PRP VBP NP ?
well , DT NNS S are : RB NP , NP , NP , NP .
we don &apos; t companies VBG NP .
we don NP VP .
and you know what my response to NP PP is ?
yes , you &apos;re RB . let NP VP .
it &apos;s true , we &apos;ve got a huge food problem , but NP NP .
this has nothing to do IN NP .
NP VP , NP VP , NP VP .
you know NP NP .
PRP VBZ RB NP .
NP VP ; NP VP .
NP VP , and S CC S , but NP , VP , and NP VP .
you know , PP NP VP , 70 percent .
DT NN IN NP IN NP .
dis@@ gra@@ ce@@ ful . dis@@ gra@@ ce@@ ful .
NP VP , and NP VP .
and WRB ? ADJP NN .
we don NP VP .
cas@@ sa@@ va &apos;s something WDT NP VP .
it &apos;s RB RB IN NP .
it &apos;s NP PP . it su@@ cks .
NP VP , NP VP , and NP VP .
and ADVP NP VP and NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP ?
DT MD VP . NP VP , but NP VP .
and all i can say IN NP is : why are we fighting PRP ?
NP VP , let NP VP
because NP VP ?
this is about VBG NP ADVP . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridi@@ cul@@ ous passion for hor@@ mon@@ es , our insi@@ st@@ ence on having NP , NP , NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
RB , PRP VBP NP ?
if we don &apos; t , if we continue to act the way NP VP , we &apos;re gu@@ il@@ ty of something that i don &apos; t think NP VP .
there &apos;s no other way to describe what &apos;s VP .
NP VP , NP VP , NP VP , and NP ADVP VP .
so after this ama@@ z@@ ingly fun conversation , you might want to VP , VP CC VP ? &quot;
absolutely . RB , PRP VBP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
we can set that time machine on anything NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
we have VP and we have VP , but when NP VP and NP VP , we &apos;re going VP .
i know that NP VP , and as far as NP VP .
VBP NP .
VBP NP .
for some time i have been interested IN NP . &quot;
IN NP , NN NNS VBP NP SBAR -- IN NP , IN NP , IN S VBD NP .
something fa@@ ke becomes something real because IN NP VBZ NP .
in order for us to understand each other , i want to start by VBG NP NP .
and PRP VBP VP . NP VP VBZ NP PP .
i learned NP NP IN NP .
NP VP , and ADVP NP VP .
and then i &apos;ll explain WRB NP VP .
so , here &apos;s WP VP .
the kni@@ fe , WDT NP VP ; my hand , WDT NP VP .
i &apos;m just going to hold NP PP IN NP .
i &apos;ll VB NP ADVP .
and to make JJ nothing goes up or down my sle@@ e@@ ve NP VP .
that way NP VP can NN VB , RB RB as NP VP nothing can VB ADVP NP .
and DT NN IN NP is RB JJ .
NP VP , and ADVP , SBAR , NP VP .
PP NP VP , and NP VP .
nothing goes RP CC RP NP , NP . and you can VB NP .
ta - da !
so , this is a trick that i often teach to young children that are interested in NN , because NP VP -- even though NP VP .
NP PP PP VB NP .
WHNP S VBZ NP .
i hold NP PP .
i say NP VP , that is a lie .
the reason NP VP is because NP ADVP DT NN IN NP .
in NP SBAR , to NP VP .
nice one .
someone who didn NP VP is out there .
so , it goes IN NP , IN ADVP , right .
and as NP VP .
and we could talk about why this is de@@ cep@@ tive , why you don &apos; t notice NP VP , and NP , NP VP , one , two , three . it groups them .
but that &apos;s not RB WP NP VP . right ? and then i open my hand up .
obviously it &apos;s cl@@ inging there , not by NN NN , but by NP , NP being RB .
and then WRB NP VP , same thing , as NP VP , DT NN NN IN co@@ vers NP PP .
PRP VBP NP ADVP . PRP VBP NP PRT .
there is a trick NP VP . thanks .
now , what does that have to do IN NP ?
i read DT NN DT NN or so IN NP really ble@@ w PRP$ NN ADJP .
NP VP , so NP VP .
NP VP -- NP VP -- NP VP .
but if you VBP NP S , and VB NP PP , it is actually meas@@ ur@@ ably more effective .
even though NP PP VBZ NP -- they &apos;re sugar p@@ ills .
but a white p@@ ill is not as good IN NP .
WP ? DT RB VBD NP PRT .
turns out though , that NP VP .
if NP VP , they &apos;re ADJP PP .
a color@@ ed cap@@ su@@ le , that &apos;s yellow IN NP and red IN NP is better than a white cap@@ su@@ le .
do@@ sage has something to do IN NP .
NP NP-TMP VP -- NP VP . sorry .
but DT NN VBZ ...
... these do@@ sages have something to do IN NP .
and the form has something to do IN NP .
and if PRP VBP NP PP , you &apos;ve go IN NP .
right ? NP PP , and NP VP ...
well this is NP PP , it &apos;s RB RB JJR IN NP .
NP VP , NP , INTJ NP VP .
the point is the white p@@ ill is not as good as NP VP .
and none of it has any real pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical quality , it &apos;s only your belief that makes it real IN NP and makes a stron@@ ger effect .
i wanted to see if NP VP .
and take NP SBAR and make NP VP .
and we know from that study that WRB NP VP , you go IN NP .
DT VBZ NP . NP VP , and NP VP .
DT VBZ ADVP NP . DT VBZ RB NP .
DT VBZ NP ADVP . DT VBZ RB NP .
i &apos;m going to pi@@ er@@ ce my skin and run this need@@ le through IN NP .
SBAR : SBAR : NP VP , and NP VP .
ADVP , NP VP -- PP , NP VP .
you &apos;ll get TO VP , you can look away too if NP VP .
so , here is what happens , right here , the beginning of my fl@@ es@@ h at the lower part of my arm NP ADVP VP .
PRP VBP ADJP , NP . am PRP VBG NP PRT ?
ok , and then just through NP NP , and RB out NP PP .
now , essentially we &apos;re in the same position NP VP .
sort of .
but you can &apos; NP VP can you ?
so , let NP VP . DT VBZ NP , five .
UH , UH ...
i know what people think WRB NP VP .
they go , &quot; well , he &apos;s certainly not du@@ m@@ b enough to stab PRP IN NP IN S .
so , let NP VP .
WRB VP NP VP ? pretty good .
UH , PRP VBP .
and NP PP VP , VP , i didn NP ADVP VP . &quot;
NP PP VBP VP .
let NP VP .
DT RB VBZ NP . DT VBZ RB NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
i &apos;m JJ . if NP VP , VB ADVP , don JJ NN NN IN NP .
NP VP , S VP and ADVP , SBAR NP VP .
well let NP VP .
UH , RB PRP VBZ .
normally now , i would VB NP PRT .
NP VP , and NP VP .
but i think PP , NP VP .
i will be seeing PRP JJ NNS IN NP .
i hope you &apos;re looking RB IN NP . thank you very much .
everybody talks IN NP DT NNS .
NP VP and NP VP , and EX VBD NP .
there is NP PP , IN NP .
there is NP PP .
everybody would like to make NP ADJP .
but in NP PP , there are NP SBAR .
and my talk today will be RB IN NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
NP PP VBZ NP .
it turns out that NP VP , because NP VP .
i think NP VP , but by and large , this is NP SBAR and we &apos;ll S .
NP VP ; ADVP , NP VP .
and NP VP , and NP VP .
and NP VP , and NP VP - VP PP NP .
NP VP , DT VBZ NP .
RB NP NP IN S .
RB , NP VP , and NP VP .
and then he ad@@ ded , really quite emotion@@ ally , NP VP .
but PRP VBD NP .
WP NP VP were NP PP .
he had VBN NP .
he had had NP PP .
PRP VBD PP SBAR ; NP VP , and NP VP .
what this is telling us , really , is that we might be thinking IN NP and IN NP .
NP VP , but ADVP NP VP .
NP VP VBZ NP VP ? &quot;
and RB EX VBZ NP , and NP VP , and NP VP ? &quot;
CC VP how was NP PP ? &quot; or something like DT .
NP VP , and S VP .
RB , DT NN NN VBZ NP .
and NP ADVP VP -- NP VP .
we don NP ADVP VP .
PRP$ NN VBZ NP NP , that is , S .
and let NP VP .
DT VBZ NP .
those are NP VP .
PRP VBD S . NP VP , but NP VP .
they were asked VP .
ADVP VP , DT VBP NP .
and you are asked , &quot; who IN NP VBD NP ? &quot;
and PRP VBZ NP .
clearly , patient b suff@@ ered more -- his col@@ on@@ o@@ scop@@ y VP , and DT NN IN NP WDT NP VP , and more .
but now there is another question : &quot; how much did NP VP ? &quot;
and RB VBZ DT NN .
the surprise is that NP VP .
NP VP , and because NP VP .
CC NP VP -- but NP VP ...
but NP PP VBZ ADJP .
and NP VP ; NP VP .
WRB VBP NP VP ?
because NP VP , and ADVP , ADVP , VP how bad was DT JJ NN , IN NP ? &quot;
and it was ADJP PP , IN NP .
now this is a direct conflict between the experi@@ en@@ cing NP CC NP self .
IN NP , RB , NN VBD NP .
now , what NP VP , and S , CC S -- you could actually ex@@ tend NP PP IN S .
that will cause NP , CC ADJP .
and SBAR , NP VP , and NP VP .
what VBZ NP ?
and that is true of DT NNS that NP VP , and NP VP .
WP VP are NP , NP CC NP .
end@@ ings are RB , RB JJ and , IN NP , NP VP .
RB , DT VBG NN VBZ NP ADVP .
it has moments of NP , NP .
and you can ask : what happens IN NP ?
CC NP VP : NP VP .
NP VP -- and NP VP , NP VP , NP VP ; NP VP ; PP , NP VP -- NP VP .
most of PRP are completely ignor@@ ed IN NP .
and yet , somehow you get the sense that NP VP .
it &apos;s the fin@@ ite resource that we &apos;re spending while NP VP .
and SBAR NP VP , but NP VP .
ADVP NP VP , and NP VP .
DT JJS NN IN NP is IN NP .
from DT NN IN NP , if NP VP , and NP VP , then the two - week vac@@ ation is twice as good IN NP .
that &apos;s not the way NP VP .
for the remem@@ ber@@ ing self , a two - week vac@@ ation is RB JJR IN NP because NP VP .
you have not VBN NP .
and PP , NP VP ; NP VP .
now , the remem@@ ber@@ ing self does more than VB CC VB NP .
NP VP , ADVP NP VP , and NP VP .
the S self has NP PP .
we actually don NP VP , we choose between NP PP .
and even WRB NP VP , we don NP PP RB IN NP .
we think IN NP .
and basically you can look PP , NP VP , and NP VP .
NP VP ; NP VP .
and this is a bit hard to justi@@ fy NP VP .
NP VP , WRB JJ do PRP VBP NP ?
that is one of the explan@@ ations that is given IN NP .
and SBAR , NP VP , and NP VP .
and i probably have consum@@ ed my memor@@ ies of DT NML NN , NP VP , for NP PP .
now , if i had ever opened NP PP IN NP , i would have spent another hour .
RB , NP VP , and NP VP .
there seems to VB NP .
RB , NP VP , NP VP , IN SBAR ?
so i want NP VP .
imagine that PP , NP VP , and NP VP .
RB , would PRP VB NP ?
and IN S , EX VBZ NP , and NP VP , and NP VP .
why do we pick the vac@@ ations we do is a problem that con@@ fron@@ ts us with NP PP .
now , the two selves bring RP NP PP .
there are really two concep@@ ts of happiness WDT NP VP .
so you can ask : how happy is DT VBG NP ?
and then you would ask : how happy are NP PP ?
and they &apos;re DT -- NP VP .
what are NP SBAR ?
and , by the way , now we are capable of getting a pretty good idea of DT NN IN NP .
if you ask IN NP , it &apos;s a completely different thing .
this is not about WRB ADVP NP VP .
it is about how satis@@ fied or pleas@@ ed the person is when that person thinks IN NP .
RB JJ notion .
anyone WP VP is going IN NP IN NP , and i bel@@ ong to NP PP - being , who &apos;ve been mess@@ ing RP NP PP IN NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
so in recent years , we have be@@ gun to learn IN NP .
and the main lesson NP VP is S .
NP VP , and NP VP .
just to VB NP NP , the cor@@ relation is about NN .
what that means is if NP VP , and NP VP how much would you know about his hei@@ ght ?
INTJ , NP VP , but NP VP .
PRP VBP NP .
if NP VP , you have NP PP .
RB DT NN VBZ ADJP .
we know something about what contro@@ ls NN IN NP .
we know NP VP , goals are very important .
we know that NP VP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
so if you want to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze NP PP , you are going to end up VBG NP .
the bottom line of what i &apos;ve VBN ADVP is that we really should not think IN NP IN NP NP HYPH SBAR .
PRP VBZ NP .
now , very quickly , another reason NP VP about happiness is that NP VP , and we actually live .
so , if NP VP , you are not VBG S .
when PRP VBP NP , you think NP VP .
and what happens is SBAR , NP VP , and that NP VP .
well , it turns out that NP VP and it &apos;s not even very important IN NP .
but RB , IN S , NP VP -- NP VP .
and it &apos;s sort of interesting to tra@@ ce what is going to happen IN NP .
well , their experi@@ en@@ cing NN is not going VP .
we know IN .
but NP VP : NP VP .
it is very difficult to think straight about well - being , and i hope i have VBN NP NP .
VBP NP .
thank you . i &apos;ve got DT NN IN NP .
VBP NP ADVP .
now , when we were IN NP NP IN , you mentioned to me that EX VBD NP .
is that something NP VP ?
dan@@ iel ka@@ h@@ ne@@ man : JJ .
i think NP VP .
we found that IN NP to NP PP .
WRB NP VP .
and it turns out that , below an income of NP NP , for americans -- and DT VBZ NP , like 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 , so it &apos;s a large repres@@ ent@@ ative sam@@ ple -- below an income of NP NP ...
6@@ 0,000 .
NN : CD .
NP VP , and NP VP .
IN NP , PRP VBP NP .
i mean NP VP .
clearly , what VBZ VP is NN S , but NN IN NP certainly bu@@ ys NP NP , and we can VB NP ADVP .
in terms of NP , NP , you get a different story .
the more money NP VP , the more satis@@ fied you are .
that does not hold IN NP .
but dan@@ ny , the JJ JJ en@@ dea@@ vor is about NP , NP , NP .
if people took seriously that NP PRN NP VP we believe about , like IN NP , tax@@ ation policy and so forth .
is there any chance that politicians , that the country generally , would take DT NN IN NP seriously and run public policy based IN NP ?
d@@ k : you know NP VP .
DT NN VBZ VP , but PP , NP VP , and PP NP VP .
people are recogni@@ zing that NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
how to en@@ h@@ ance happiness goes very different ways depen@@ ding on WRB NP VP , and whether NP VP or you think of the experi@@ en@@ cing self .
this is going to influence policy , NP VP , in NNS S .
in the united states , eff@@ or@@ ts are being made to measure NP PP .
this is VBG S , i think , within NP CC NP , NP PP .
well , it seems to me that this issue will -- or at least should be -- NP VP .
thank you so much for VBG NP .
VBP NP , NP .
PRP VBP NP . PRP VBP NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
RB , NP VP , and NP VP .
right now we spend NP NP VP .
some of you might be thinking , &quot; NP VP .
maybe too much time , consi@@ der@@ ing how many NP NP VBP S . &quot;
but actually , according IN NP , it &apos;s ADVP NP VP .
three billion hours a week is not nearly enough game play to solve NP VP .
in fact , i believe that if NP VP , we need VP .
i &apos;ve calcul@@ ated the total NP VP .
so , that &apos;s probably a bit of a counter@@ intui@@ tive idea , so i &apos;ll say it again , let it sin@@ k in : if we want to solve problems like NP , NP , NP , NP , NP , i believe that we need to as@@ pi@@ re VP DT NN , IN NP .
no . i &apos;m JJ . i am .
here &apos;s why . this picture pretty much su@@ ms up why i think NP VP . truly .
this is a portra@@ it by NP VP .
NP VP , so NP VP .
and DT VBZ NP .
now , if NP VP , you might VB NP .
you probably see NP PP , NP PP , but NP , NP .
IN S , PRP MD VP , and NP VP , and NP ADVP VP .
this is a gam@@ er who is on the ver@@ ge of NP VP .
oh , you &apos;ve heard IN NP . ok , good , so we have DT NNS IN NP .
an epi@@ c win is an out@@ come that is so extra@@ ordin@@ arily positive NP VP .
it was almost beyond NP PP .
and when you get there you are sho@@ cked to discover WP NP VP . that is an epi@@ c win .
this is NP PP .
and this is the face that we need to see on NP PP as NP VP .
now , unfortunately this is NP PP .
NP VP , and NP VP . can PRP VB ? yes . good .
this is actually me making the &quot; NP VP .
this is NP PP .
and this is a problem that NP VP .
we feel that we are not as good IN NP as NP VP .
and PRP VBP NP S .
we do achieve RBR IN NP . but i also mean good as in NP , VP .
and when we &apos;re in game worl@@ ds i believe that NP VP , the most likely to help IN NP notice , the most likely to stick IN NP ADVP PP takes , to get up after failure and try again .
and in real life , when PRP VBP NP , when PRP VBP NP , we often don NP VP .
NP VP , NP VP , NP VP , RB JJ , JJ CC JJ .
we never have NP SBAR , they just don NP VP .
so , that &apos;s what i wanted to study WRB NP VP .
what about games makes it impossible to feel that NP VP ?
how can we take DT NNS IN NP and apply PRP IN NP ?
so , i looked IN NP IN NP .
and i started to notice a few things that make epi@@ c w@@ ins so possible IN NP .
so , NP VP , there are NP PP .
but not just any mission , it &apos;s a mission that is perfectly mat@@ ched IN NP . right ?
so , you can VB NP .
they never give you a challenge that you can &apos; NP VP .
but it is on NP PP . so , you have VP , but there &apos;s NP PP .
ADVP VP NP , NP VP .
and there are also NNS IN NP .
everywhere you go , hundreds of thousands of people ready to work IN NP VP .
that &apos;s not something that we have IN NP .
and also there is NP , NP .
and RB PRP VBP NP .
you guys have heard IN S and NP HYPH NP , and NP HYPH NP .
we don NP VP .
when i get off this stage i &apos;m not going to have NP HYPH NP , and NP , CC NP .
i don NP VP .
now , the problem with NP PP is that NP VP .
it &apos;s RB JJR IN NP .
so , so far , colle@@ c@@ tively PDT DT NN IN NP have VBN NP S .
RB , DT VBZ RB NP .
it might sound like NP VP .
but to put DT IN NP : NP IN was when NP NP VBD PRT .
DT VBD NP .
okay , so WRB NP VP , the only way NP VP is TO VP .
but it &apos;s ADVP JJ . because NP VP , we &apos;re ADVP VP .
we are evol@@ ving to be NP CC NP .
DT VBZ ADJP . PRP VBP NP .
RB , VP ; NP VP : NP VP .
now 10,000 hours is NP PP .
first of all , for NP VP you will spend in NP PP to NML NN if NP VP .
so , we have an entire par@@ alle@@ l track of NP VP .
and some of you have probably read NP VP . &quot;
so , you would have heard of his theory of NP , NP .
it &apos;s based on this great cognitive science research that if NP VP , we will VB NP .
we will be as good at whatever we do IN NP .
and so , now WP NP VP is NP PP .
so , NP VP , &quot; WHNP SQ ? &quot;
because if NP VP , we would VB NP .
this is how many people we now have in the world who spend NP NP VP .
these are NP , NP .
and in the next decade we &apos;re going to have another billion gam@@ ers who are extra@@ ordin@@ arily good at WDT NP VP .
if you don NP VP , this is coming .
the game industry is developing VP NP with NP PP so that NP , PP , VP .
they expect NP PP .
it will bring PRP RP IN NP .
so , i &apos;ve started to think about WP NP VP .
here are the four things NP VP . the first is ur@@ gent optimis@@ m .
ok , think IN NP .
ur@@ gent optimis@@ m is the desire to act immediately to t@@ ack@@ le an ob@@ stac@@ le , combin@@ ed with the belief that NP VP .
gam@@ ers always believe that NP VP , and that NP VP .
gam@@ ers don NP VP .
gam@@ ers are NP PP .
RB NP NP IN NP .
and the reason is , NP VP .
we trust that NP VP , they &apos;ll stay with DT NN until NP VP .
and so , VBG NP ADVP ADVP buil@@ ds IN NP .
and NP ADVP VP .
bli@@ ss@@ ful produ@@ c@@ tivity . PRP VBP NP .
NP VP VBZ NP NP , NP .
it &apos;s because NP VP .
we know that NP VP .
and gam@@ ers are willing VP , if NP VP .
RB : JJ NN .
gam@@ ers love to be atta@@ ched IN NP .
ADVP , NP PP : ADVP , NP NP VP , NP PP .
NP PP , IN NP , VBZ NP .
QP NNS VBP NP NP-TMP .
they have comp@@ iled more information about NP PP on DT NN than NP VP .
they are VBG NP .
they are building an epi@@ c knowledge resource about NP PP .
INTJ , ADVP NP VP : NP VP .
these are people who believe that NP VP .
and the only problem is that NP VP .
that &apos;s the problem WDT NP VP .
there &apos;s NP VP ed@@ ward ca@@ stron@@ o@@ va .
his work is brilliant . he looks at why people are invest@@ ing NP CC NP .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re wit@@ n@@ ess@@ ing what amo@@ unts IN NP IN NP . &quot;
and PRP VBZ NP . RB , PRP VBZ ADJP .
and PRP VBZ ...
not like me -- NP VP ; NP VP .
but he says that NP VP .
NP VP ; NP VP .
so , he says for now it makes NP PP VP .
now , i also agree that NP VP .
but it is not , IN NP , DT JJ NN .
we have to start making ADVP IN NP .
so , i take my inspiration from NP SBAR .
these are NP , VP . right ?
before NP VP , we had NP NP .
and these represent NP VP .
and if NP VP , you might VB NP .
her@@ od@@ ot@@ us says that NP VP .
appar@@ ently , there was such a sever@@ e fam@@ ine that NP VP .
NNS VBD VP . NNS VBD VP .
NP VP , PRP VBD NP .
ADVP , PP , NP VP and NP VP : PP , NP VP , and PP , NP VP .
and they would VB ADVP VP , and VB NP PP , they would ignor@@ e the fact that NP VP .
and PP , NP VP ; and PP , NP VP .
and according IN NP , they passed NP , VP .
now , this is RB , NP VP , WRB NP VP .
we &apos;re using games to VB NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
but it doesn NP VP .
this is RB JJ .
according to her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , after 18 years the fam@@ ine wasn &apos; t getting better , so the king decided they would VB NP NP .
they divi@@ ded DT JJ NN IN NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
now , this sounds JJ , JJ ?
but recently , dna evidence has shown that NP ADVP VP .
and so , recently , scientists have suggest@@ ed that NP VP .
and ge@@ ologists have found evidence of a global cool@@ ing that la@@ sted IN NP .
RB , DT JJ NN MD VP .
they might have actually saved their culture by playing games , es@@ cap@@ ing to NNS IN NP , and then been so inspired , and knew so much about how to come together with games , that they actually saved NP NP .
okay , we can VB NP .
we &apos;ve been playing NN IN NP .
that was NP PP . that was NP IN .
they played di@@ ce games for 18 years , we &apos;ve been playing NN IN NP .
i say NP VP .
now , they had half the civilization go off in NP PP , so that NP where i get NP NP-TMP PP IN .
let NP VP .
now , i know PRP VP , VP ? &quot; well , that &apos;s WP NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
we do not want to try to VB NP .
WP NP VP is VB NP .
we want to imagine the best - case scen@@ ari@@ o out@@ come , and then we want to em@@ power people to make NP NP .
we want to VB NP , and RB VB NP NP S .
i &apos;m just going to very brie@@ fly show you three games that i &apos;ve made that are an attemp@@ t to VB NP NP S .
so , this is NN IN NP .
we made DT NN IN NP .
this is NP SBAR .
NP VP , but NP VP . ADVP SBAR , NP VP , and ADVP NP VP , NP VP , and NP VP . and RB PRP VBP NP PP , S .
NP VP , and NP VP .
and i can tell you that NP VP .
nobody wants to change WRB NP VP , or because NP VP .
but if NP VP run IN IN NP .
this is NP PP S .
challenge NP VP , &quot; NP PP have kept up DT NNS WHNP S .
so , for the next world - saving game , we decided to a@@ im NP : NP .
we did NP VP .
and the pre@@ mis@@ e was a super@@ computer has calcul@@ ated that NP VP .
this super@@ computer was VBN NP .
PRP VBD NP S .
you know jer@@ ry bru@@ ck@@ hei@@ mer movies , PRP VBP NP -- you &apos;ve VP NP , and they all have something VP .
but IN NP , RB IN S , NP VP , and NP VP . &quot;
we had 8@@ ,000 people play NP PP .
they came up with 500 in@@ san@@ ely creative solutions that you can go online , if you google NP , NP and see .
so , finally , the last game , we &apos;re laun@@ ching NP VP . this is a game done IN NP .
if NP VP you will VB VP .
VP , and NP VP .
we &apos;ve VP , we &apos;ve got le@@ vel@@ ing up in NP PP .
i would like to invi@@ te NP PP VP .
so , i &apos;m going VP .
i want to VB NP .
what do you think VP ?
NP VP , S , but NP VP .
well i hope that NP VP .
we have NP : NP .
i really hope that NP VP .
and that &apos;s my hope , that NP VP .
SBAR , NP VP , and NP VP .
so , i say : let NP VP .
VBP NP .
i &apos;d like to share IN NP NP SBAR .
NP ADVP VP , but NP VP , and NP VP looked RP DT NN NN JJ NN S .
let NP VP .
ADVP ADJP , NP : S .
NNS , JJ , JJ , JJ . &quot;
NP VP , S , CC S , NP VP , and NP VP .
you know , of course , this is my ra@@ g@@ ge@@ dy old thes@@ au@@ rus so i &apos;m thinking this must be NP , NP ?
but , in fact , the print date was the early 198@@ 0s , when i would VB VP and as related IN NP IN NP .
and , need@@ less TO VP , thank god NP VP .
i mean , from this ent@@ ry , it would seem that NP VP .
so , i immediately went to look IN NP , expe@@ cting TO VP .
here &apos;s NP PP .
RB , PRP VBZ RB ADJP .
PRP VBP NP S . &quot;
so , it &apos;s RB RB IN NP .
it &apos;s WP NP VP .
it &apos;s IN NP .
our language affec@@ ts our thinking and WRB NP VP and WRB NP VP .
in fact , many ancient societies , including NP CC NP , believed that PP NP ADVP VP .
so , what reality do we want to call into NP : NP ?
by cas@@ ually doing something as simple as nam@@ ing NP , NP , we might be putting li@@ ds and ca@@ sting sha@@ do@@ ws on their power .
wouldn &apos; t we want VP ?
one such person who opened NNS IN NP was my childhood doctor at the a@@ .@@ i@@ . du@@ po@@ nt institute in NP , NP .
NP VP , so NP VP .
and dr. p always wor@@ e really color@@ ful bo@@ w ties and had the very perfect dis@@ position to work IN NP .
i loved almost everything about NP VP .
NP VP , NP VP , and NP VP -- PRP VP , VP . i hat@@ ed PRP .
and , NP VP , i was RB NP , PP , PP .
and , NP-TMP , NP VP and NP VP , &quot; wow . ai@@ mee , you are such NP , SBAR .
when you do break PRP , i &apos;m going to VB NP NP . &quot;
now , of course , this was a simple plo@@ y on dr. p &apos;s part to get me to do the exer@@ cis@@ es i didn NP VP , but what he effectively did for NP VP .
and i have to wonder today to what ex@@ tent NP CC NP VBN NP PP ADVP .
this is an example of how adults in NP PP can ig@@ ni@@ te NP PP .
but , IN NP , NP VP .
our NN NN &apos; t caught RP IN NP IN NP .
certainly , from NP , NP , NP , NP CC NP , so they can VB S .
so , perhaps technology is reve@@ aling more clearly to PRP now WP VP : that NP VP , and that NP VP .
DT JJ NN S , NP VP , and NP VP : NP ADVP VP , and NP ADVP VP , and PRP VBP S .
impli@@ c@@ it in DT NN IN NP ad@@ ver@@ sity &quot; is the idea that NP VP , or WP NP VP .
but , in fact , we are changed . we are mar@@ ked , IN NP , by a challenge , whether physi@@ cally , emotion@@ ally or both .
and i &apos;m going to suggest that NP VP .
ad@@ ver@@ sity isn &apos; t an ob@@ stac@@ le that we need to get RB IN NP VP .
it &apos;s NN IN NP .
and i tend to think IN NP IN NP .
ADVP NP VP , but NP VP .
and , certainly , i &apos;m not trying to di@@ min@@ ish NP , NP , IN NP &apos;s NN .
NP VP , and NP VP .
ADVP , NP VP , but VP .
and we do a dis@@ service to our kids when we make NP VP .
there &apos;s NP PP and NP PP .
and , tru@@ th@@ fully , the only real and consi@@ stent dis@@ ability i &apos;ve had VP is the world ever thinking that i could be described IN NP .
in our desire to protect those NP VP , or , indeed , a pro@@ g@@ no@@ sis on NP PP , we have to make sure that we don NP VP .
perhaps the exi@@ sting model of only looking at WP VBZ VP and WRB VBP NP VP , ser@@ ves to be more dis@@ ab@@ ling to DT NN IN NP .
by not tre@@ ating NP PP , IN S , we are creating another ill on NP PP .
we are effectively gra@@ ding NP VP .
so we need to see IN NP and IN NP .
and , most importantly , there &apos;s a partner@@ ship between NP CC NP .
so it &apos;s not about de@@ valu@@ ing , or ne@@ g@@ ating , these more trying times as something we want to avoid or swe@@ ep IN NP , but instead to find NP VP .
so maybe the idea NP VP there is not so much VP , VP , VP , ADVP VP .
and , perhaps , if NP VP , we &apos;re NP VP .
NP-TMP NP VP , and NP VP .
to par@@ ap@@ hr@@ ase : NP VP , nor VBZ NP NP ; PRP VBZ NP .
conflict is NP PP .
from darwin &apos;s work , am@@ on@@ gst others , we can recognize that the human ability TO VP is driven IN NP IN NP IN NP .
RB , RB , NP , NP , VBZ NP .
and , perhaps , until NP VP , we don S .
maybe that &apos;s what ad@@ ver@@ sity gives us : a sense of NP , NP .
so , we can VB NP NP .
we can re-@@ imagine ad@@ ver@@ sity as NP NP .
maybe we can see PRP IN NP .
ad@@ ver@@ sity is just change that NP VP .
i think the greatest ad@@ ver@@ sity that we &apos;ve created for NP VP .
RB , WP VP ?
RB NP NP .
ADVP NP , EX VBZ ADJP . NP NP , and MD NP VP ?
i don NP VP .
if we can change DT NN IN NP , to be NP RBR dangerous -- we can rele@@ ase NP PP , and invi@@ te NP VP .
anthropo@@ logi@@ sts tell us that NP VP .
there &apos;s evidence that NNS , NP IN , VBD NP PP , and perhaps it &apos;s because NP VP .
NP VP ; NP VP .
NP IN , NP VP , and NP VP .
NP VP : NP VP .
i hear NP VP . &quot;
and NP VP , and NP VP . PRP VBP NP .
and i said , &quot; NP VP , have we met ? i don &apos; t remember NN NP . &quot;
NP VP , RB ADVP , NP VP .
i mean , when we met NP VP . &quot;
UH , DT NN .
and , CC IN NP , RB , PRP VBD VP .
this man was NP , NP .
and so my mother &apos;s pr@@ en@@ at@@ al physi@@ cian had gone on NN , so NP VP .
and , IN S , NP VP -- NP VP .
he said to me , &quot; i had TO VP , and you would never have the kind of NP CC NP , and you &apos;ve been making li@@ ar out IN NP ever since . &quot;
the extraordinary thing is that NP VP .
and he called NP PP NP , NP .
no pro@@ g@@ no@@ sis can account for how powerful this could be as NP VP .
and NP VP , NP VP , NP , CC FRAG . &quot;
see , dr. ke@@ an made DT NN IN NP .
he understood that NP VP and WP NP VP .
and there &apos;s been a shift in PRP$ NN IN NP , in that , if NP VP , if NP VP , i wouldn S .
i as@@ pi@@ red to NP PP back then .
but if NP VP , i &apos;m not RB JJ .
and it &apos;s because of the experiences i &apos;ve had IN NP , not in NN IN NP i &apos;ve had IN NP .
and perhaps this shift in me has happened because NP VP and cast sha@@ do@@ ws on me .
UH , NP VP , and NP VP .
if NP VP -- NP VP -- IN S , you are educ@@ ating PRP IN NP .
you &apos;re VBG NP S .
in fact , the ex@@ act meaning of the word &quot; educ@@ ate &quot; comes IN NP . &quot;
it means NN VP . &quot;
RB RB , NP VBP NP VP ?
there was a case study done in 196@@ 0s britain , when they were moving IN NP IN NP .
it &apos;s VBN NP . we call NP NP .
it &apos;s separ@@ ating students from NP , NP , NP , NP CC ADVP .
and NP NP VBP VP .
UH , NP VP , NP VP , and PP , NP VP .
and , PP , NP , VP PRP VBD NP . &quot;
and that &apos;s what happened IN NP .
NP SBAR , IN NP .
a cru@@ cial part of DT NN NN was that NP VP .
the teachers didn NP VP .
they were simply told , &quot; NP VP , &apos; NP VP . &apos; &quot; and that &apos;s how they went about VBG NP and VBG NP .
ADVP , NP VP , NP VP , NP VP , NP ADVP VP .
if ADVP , NP VP , then we are RB VBG NP ADVP .
when a spirit has those quali@@ ties , we are able to create NP CC NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
come , dance IN NP . come , dance IN NP . &apos; &quot; thank you .
how would you like to be better than NP VP ?
suppose i said that , PP , NP VP .
or maybe you &apos;d like VP .
would you like VP ?
how about living longer IN NP ?
or perhaps you &apos;re one of those who &apos;s always ye@@ ar@@ ned IN NP .
WDT NP MD NP VP ?
which would NP SBAR ?
creativity .
how many people would VB NP ?
raise PRP$ NNS . let NP VP .
a few . probably about as many as NP VP .
DT NNS RB JJ .
how many would op@@ t IN NP ?
RB DT JJ JJR .
WRB IN NP ?
DT JJ JJR .
WP IN NP ?
ah , the majority . that makes NP VP .
if NP VP , it would VB NP .
is PRP RB JJ ?
or , VP ?
NP VP , but NP VP .
the great 20th - century gene@@ tic@@ ist , t@@ .@@ g@@ . do@@ b@@ z@@ han@@ sky , who was also DT NN IN NP , once wrote an es@@ say that he ti@@ t@@ led &quot; NP VP . &quot;
now if you are one of those who does not VB NP , this would be a very good time to turn off your hearing aid , take out your personal communic@@ ations device -- PRP VBP NP NP -- and perhaps take NP PP VBZ NP PP , because nothing in the rest of this talk is going to make DT NN RB IN NP .
but if you do VB NP , consider this : is PRP ADVP IN NP , or is PRP IN NP ?
does it apply IN NP , or does it apply IN NP ?
this is NP PP .
PP , NP VP : NP VP ; NP VP .
NP PP , NP PP , is , IN NP , NP SBAR .
we bran@@ ch off IN NP to NP PP ago .
in the inter@@ val , there have been NP PP .
DT VBP VP .
we have been RB IN NP .
NP VP , but ADVP , PP , NP VP .
do you realize that NP VP ?
NP VP ; NP VP .
and speaking of bacteria , do you realize that NP VP ?
RB CD NNS JJR .
NP VP , VBP NP VP ?
our gut is NP PP .
NP VP , NP VP , NP VP , NP VP .
and you &apos;re going to provide all the nutri@@ tion that NP VP .
it &apos;s really like NP PP , with NP PP .
but otherwise , you are DT JJ NN IN NP , just as NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
but what will come IN NP ?
are we at NP PP ?
or VP ?
now let NP VP , 14 billion years ago -- NP , NP , RB VBG PP .
PP , NP VP ; NP , PP ; and NP-TMP , NP VP .
DT VBD NP .
NP ADVP VP , so NP VP .
now when i was NP PP , i took my first biology class .
i was fascin@@ ated IN NP .
NP VP , and NP VP : PP , NP ADVP VP , and NP VP .
but at NP SBAR , things start VP .
JJ NN VBZ NP .
and very importantly , with the introdu@@ ction of sexual re@@ production that pas@@ ses IN NP , the rest of the body becomes expen@@ d@@ able .
in fact , you could say that DT NN IN NP en@@ ters IN NP IN NP .
ADVP NP VP , SBAR , NP VP -- NP VP , but PP , NP VP .
i &apos;ve come to understand NP PP .
and one night , there &apos;s NP PP .
PRP VBZ NP .
standing before NP VP .
she looks IN NP and says , &quot; NP VP . &quot;
&quot; NP VP , &quot; says NN , NP SBAR . &quot;
i came to realize , as DT NN , that NP VP .
i was trying to VB NP .
i wanted to keep NP ADJP .
i wanted to re@@ store NN IN NP .
i wanted us to VB NP .
evolution is all about pas@@ sing IN NP IN NP , adap@@ ting and survi@@ ving IN NP IN NP .
from NP PP , you and i are IN NP .
i think NP VP , &quot; NP VP .
i want to VB NP PP . &quot;
evolution does not RB VB NP .
it doesn &apos; t necessarily fa@@ vor NP CC NP .
evolution favor@@ s NP ADJP IN NP .
that is NP PP .
at the bottom of the ocean , bacteria that are ther@@ m@@ op@@ hi@@ lic and can survive IN NP , if fish were there , sous - vide coo@@ ked fish , ne@@ ver@@ th@@ eless , have managed to make that NP PP .
so what does this mean , as NP VP , and as NP VP , and RB as NP VP , i would say that there are DT NN IN NP .
the first is that NP VP .
we have reach@@ ed NP PP .
CC NP VP , ADVP , NP VP .
and secon@@ dly , we as a species have so con@@ figured our environment that NP VP as well as we ada@@ pt to it .
and PP , NP VP and S VP .
a second possibility is that NP VP .
and the argument here would be that NP VP , but NP VP .
and as far as NP VP , WRB NP VP , there will VB NP .
but RB VBZ NP , NP .
i call NP UCP PP IN NP .
RB WRB MD NP VP ?
how could it be possible that NP VP ?
consider , first , the reality that NP NP-TMP , IN NP , VBP VP .
they &apos;re , IN NP , VP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
think also , if NP VP .
WP if NP VP ?
wouldn &apos; t you want VP ?
if NP VP , DT NN IN NP are VBG S .
NP VP , and NP VP .
PRP VBD NP .
the year after NP VP , you could VB NP PP .
today , you can have a complete sequence of the three billion base pa@@ irs in the human genome IN NP and IN NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
NP IN , NP PP VBD NP PP , NP . &quot;
NP IN , NP VP , and PP , NP VP .
DT NNS VBP VP .
the same technology that has produced the human insu@@ lin in bacteria can make viruses that will not only protect PRP IN NP , but indu@@ ce NN IN NP .
believe it or not , there &apos;s an experiment@@ al trial going RP IN NP IN NP .
can you imagine something good coming IN IN NP ?
NP VP , and NP , VP .
VB ADVP NP .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if NP VP ?
WP if NP VP ?
who doesn NP VP ?
and then , that same analy@@ tic technology , that same engine of science that can VB NP S , will also en@@ able us to adop@@ t NP , NP .
why not have the quick wi@@ t of a ken jen@@ n@@ ings , especially if you can aug@@ ment it with NP PP ?
why not have the quick twi@@ tch muscle that will en@@ able NP VP ?
WRB RB ADVP ?
DT MD VP .
and when we are at a position where NP VP , and NP VP we want , we will have conver@@ ted JJ HYPH NN evolution into NN .
NP VP , and NP VP .
these are choices WDT NP VP .
will we use these choices to make a society that is better , NP VP , NP VP ?
or , will we sel@@ ec@@ tively choose different at@@ tribu@@ tes that we want IN NP and not IN NP ?
will we make NP SBAR ?
these are NP PP .
and most pro@@ fo@@ und@@ ly of all , will we ever be able VP , that NP VP need to make these choices wi@@ sely ?
for better or worse , and so@@ on@@ er than you may VB , these choices will be up IN NP .
VBP NP .
i want you now to imagine NP , CC NP .
PRP IN NP VBP NP .
these are NP PP , and PRP MD VP , and NP VP , and NP VP .
it is actually the true integra@@ tion of NP CC NP .
but not only that -- it will integra@@ te and network you to NP CC NP out there .
DT VBZ ADVP RB NP .
VP , NP PP VBZ VP . IN NP , and PRP VBP VP .
RB , NP VP -- ADVP NP .
so we thought NP VP .
so let me now introdu@@ ce IN NP .
IN NP , PRP MD VP . RB JJ NN IN NP .
its flexi@@ ble design allows IN NP , cra@@ w@@ ls and high - agility mov@@ ements .
it senses WP NP VP .
we are ready with our industry partner to introdu@@ ce NP , NP .
so this is IN NP .
now let NP VP .
there are NP VP .
this is IN NP .
CC NP ADVP DT JJ NN .
NP VP , ADVP , NP VP and NP VP .
but it is also the aging population that is multi@@ pl@@ ying IN NP .
and the only option , pretty much -- when it &apos;s NP CC NP -- is the wheel@@ chair .
S , IN NP , PRP MD VP .
so we thought NP VP .
let me now introdu@@ ce NP VP .
VBP NP .
am@@ anda is wearing NP VP .
PRP VBZ NP .
it &apos;s completely non-@@ invasi@@ ve , sensor@@ s in the cru@@ t@@ ches that send signals back to NP SBAR .
there are battery pac@@ ks here as well that NP VP .
i was NP JJ and IN NP .
IN NP , PRP VBD NP PP .
not ADVP , NP VP , and NP VP . &quot;
and that was NP IN .
he rob@@ bed NP PP IN NP .
adap@@ tive technology has since en@@ ab@@ led me to learn how to down@@ h@@ ill sk@@ i again , to NP CC NP .
but nothing has been invented that en@@ ables NP VP .
VBP NP .
as NP VP , NP VP , we have DT NNS S .
NP VP , and NP VP .
thanks .
back IN NP , i am NP PP .
WRB NP VP , i &apos;m VP .
now IN NP , WRB NP VP , you have VP .
PRP VBP NP .
NP VP , ADVP NP VP .
but still it was a real foot@@ race against the other volunte@@ ers to get IN NP VP .
WRB NP VP , he was VBG NP PP .
here it was , DT NN IN NP , NP VP , under DT NN , in PRP$ NNS , bar@@ e@@ foot , while NP VP .
the other volunte@@ er who had arrived just before me -- let NP VP -- got to the cap@@ tain first and was asked to go inside and save NP VP .
the dog ! i was stun@@ ned IN NP .
here was some law@@ yer or money man@@ ager who , for the rest of his life , gets to tell people that NP VP , just because NP VP .
well , i was JJ .
DT NN VBD NP PRT .
he said , NP , NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP . &quot;
PRP VBP .
so , not RB WP NP VP went -- up NP PP real &apos; fire@@ figh@@ ters , WP VP .
ADVP NP VP , but NP VP .
i car@@ ried my pay@@ load back down@@ sta@@ irs where i met NP CC NP IN NP .
we took our tre@@ as@@ ures outside to the home@@ ow@@ ner , where , RB RB , NP VP VBD NP .
a few weeks later , the department received a letter from NP VP dis@@ played in VP .
NP NP VP : NP VP .
in both NP PP and NP PP , i am NN IN NP IN NP , but i &apos;m also wit@@ ness to NP PP .
and you know WP NP VP ?
PRP RB VBP .
so as i look around this room at NP , NP , i would offer this remin@@ der : don &apos; t wait .
don NP VP &apos;s life .
if NP VP , give PRP RB .
serve NN IN NP . clean RP DT NN NN .
VB NP .
not NP VP , but NP VP .
so get IN NP . save DT NNS .
VBP NP .
NP , NP , VB ADVP .
VBP NP .
i just came back from NP SBAR .
it &apos;s NP , VP .
and no , DT NN &apos; t burning NP CC NP .
NNS CC NNS , VB NP .
this is NP PP .
bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s are , RB PP , NP ADJP .
that means we NP VP .
now , chimpanze@@ es are RB HYPH VBN IN NP .
but unfortunately , we have made too much of an em@@ ph@@ as@@ is of NP PP .
but NNS VBP NP NP .
while chimpanze@@ es are domin@@ ated IN NP , bon@@ ob@@ o society is run by em@@ powered fe@@ males .
these guys have really worked something out , since NP VP .
but unfortunately , bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s are NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
the con@@ go is a parado@@ x -- a land of extraordinary bio@@ diversity and beauty , but also the heart of NP NP -- NP PP WDT VP and cla@@ im@@ ed nearly as many lives as the first world war .
not surpris@@ ingly , this destruction also en@@ dan@@ gers NN NN .
NP VP -- and NP VP .
yet , in NP PP , you can VB NP S .
WP VBP NP ?
we know them as NP VP .
now , i &apos;m not saying NP VP .
NNS , IN NP , NP SBAR .
play is not RB NP NP .
for us and them , play VBZ NP and VBG NP .
it &apos;s where we learn VP and where we learn IN NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
and WRB NP VP , you &apos;re VP .
play is NP SBAR .
ADVP , NP VP , but NP VP .
RB , NP VP -- and NP VP .
so here , we have NP CC NP .
have a look WP NP VP .
it might be DT JJ NN IN NP , &quot; NP VP . &quot;
only i think that NP VP , right ?
yeah .
so sex play is common IN NP .
and this video is really interesting because NP VP -- while IN NP VP .
but VP VBZ NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
and NP VP , NP VP , and NP VP .
NP VP , PP , NP ADVP VP , and NP VP .
and it &apos;s that NP , VP , and ADVP NP VP .
so these are just small ta@@ sters into the insi@@ ghts that bon@@ ob@@ o give us to NP CC NP .
but they also hold a secret for NP , NP .
the secret is that NP VP .
IN NP , NN VBZ NP .
in order to ada@@ pt RB IN NP , we need to play .
but will we make NP PP ?
NN VBZ RB ADJP .
NN VBZ ADJP .
for bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s and humans ali@@ ke , life is not just red IN NP .
in NP SBAR , it might VB NP .
and so , my fellow pri@@ mates , let NP VP .
VBP NP .
i want NP VP ?
so NP NP VBG NP .
now i don NP VP .
so just imagine that IN NP .
and in this scen@@ ari@@ o , i want to imagine that , in one case , the sper@@ m is carrying NP , NP .
and IN NP , DT NN VBZ VP .
NP VP ; NP VP .
we &apos;ll come back IN NP later .
so i wear NP PP .
IN NP , PRP VBP NP .
i &apos;m DT NN IN NP , and WDT NP VP -- VBG NP SBAR they thought IN NP .
the other hat WDT NP VP is as DT NN , as NP PP .
in DT NN , WDT NP VP is NP SBAR .
NP PP , VBZ NP .
NP PP VBZ NP .
and NP PP VBZ NP .
and as a general term , we can use DT NN NN IN NP .
inter@@ sex comes IN NP .
i &apos;ll just give you a few examples of the types of ways NP VP .
RB PP , NP VP , and NP VP .
and so IN NP the te@@ stes are VBG PRT NP .
but because NP VP , the NN NN &apos; t re@@ act IN NP .
and this is NP VP .
RB NP , but NP PP .
IN NP , DT NN VBZ NP .
WRB NP VP , she looks IN NP .
she is a girl . she is raised IN NP .
and it &apos;s often not until PRP VBZ NP and NP VP , but NP VP , that somebody fig@@ ures out NP SBAR .
and they do some tests and figure out that , PP , NP ADVP VP , and NP VP .
ADVP SBAR VP , but NP VP .
NNS , IN NP , have IN NP VBN NP .
they &apos;re IN NP .
and the ad@@ ren@@ al gl@@ ands make NP , SBAR .
NP PP -- NP VP -- NP VP -- ADVP NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
the con@@ sequence is that NP VP .
ADVP NP VP ; NP VP -- PP , NP VP .
another example : a few years ago NP VP and NP ADVP .
what he had was an extreme form of NP VP .
NP VP , and PP , NP VP .
and IN NP , PRP$ NNS VBD VP , his brain was subject IN NP .
and he was born looking IN NP VBN NN .
and it was only WRB NP VP that NP VP .
okay , so just one more quick example of DT NN you can VB NP .
some people who have x@@ x chromo@@ som@@ es develop what are called o@@ vot@@ est@@ is , which is when you have o@@ vari@@ an tissue with NP VP .
and we &apos;re not exactly sure WRB NP VP .
so sex can come IN NP .
the reason that NP VP is not because NP ADVP VP .
IN NP , NNS VBP ADVP ADJP .
the reason NP VP is because NP VP .
or system has been based typically on DT NN that NP VP .
so we have the concept that what it means VP is to VB NP ; what it means to be NP SBAR , alle@@ ge@@ dly , is to have an african an@@ atom@@ y in NP PP .
and RB PRP VBP NP .
and when we &apos;re fac@@ ed with a body that actually pres@@ ents NP NP , it star@@ tles us in terms of those categ@@ ori@@ zations .
so we have NP PP .
and our nation &apos;s really fo@@ unded IN NP .
well you can imagine how star@@ t@@ ling then it is when you have children that are born who are NP PP .
where i ran IN NP the south african run@@ ner , ca@@ ster se@@ men@@ ya , had her sex called IN NP IN NP .
i had a lot of NP VP ? &quot;
and i had to explain PP ADVP VP NP .
in fact , we now know that sex is complicated enough that we have to ad@@ mit NP NP VB NP ; we actually draw that line on nature .
so WP NP VP is NP PP .
and it &apos;s not just in NP PP .
it &apos;s also in terms of race , which turns out to be va@@ stly more complicated than NP VP .
as NP VP , we get IN NP .
we look , IN NP , IN NP .
what are we to make IN NP IN S RB IN NP ?
and as we get far@@ ther and far@@ ther with our science , we get more and more into a dis@@ com@@ for@@ ted zone where we have to ac@@ knowledge that NP VP .
so we &apos;re seeing this in NP PP .
one of the places NP VP , is bat@@ tles over NP PP and NP PP .
we have difficult conver@@ sa@@ tions about IN WHNP NP VP , such that NP VP .
we have NP PP .
in the past , our ancestors never had to struggle so much with NP PP .
at most , they &apos;d stick DT NN IN NP &apos;s NN , and if NP VP , they didn NP VP .
if NP VP , you bur@@ y PRP .
but today , we have a situation WRB NP VP .
and PP , NP VP , and NP VP .
now you might think that NP VP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
understanding that these categ@@ ories are really much more un@@ stable than NP VP makes me ten@@ se .
and it makes me ten@@ se IN NP .
so IN NP , i have VP .
NP VP , S , but NP VP .
NP VP , NP VP , and NP VP .
it &apos;s because of what happened IN NP IN NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
WP NP VP VBD NP and VBD NP PP .
ADVP IN S , SBAR VP , and NP VP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
they had NP PP .
they had the idea that NP VP .
DT NN NNS VBD NP , and NP VP , and NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
now they were doing it in NN because NP VP .
and that was NP VP , but it was RB NP VP .
and it &apos;s really clear , if NP VP , NP VP , and NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
they were moving IN NP .
and if NP VP , they talk IN NP .
they don &apos; t talk about NP CC NP .
they &apos;re talking IN NP VP .
so as NP PP , they were coming IN NP IN NP .
and in doing RB , they were really setting up in NP NP .
PRP VBP NP , but NP VP , and NP VP .
so what VBD NP ADVP ?
what happened was NP , SBAR , &quot; the fact that we have a u@@ ter@@ us and o@@ var@@ ies is not significant enough in terms of DT NN to mean that NP VP . , etc . &quot;
and women success@@ fully argu@@ ed IN .
next came NP VP a woman ? &quot;
we find NP PP IN NP VBG , IN S . &quot;
again , NNS IN NP appe@@ aling IN NP IN NP , again , success@@ fully .
we see DT JJ NN IN NP .
the problem is , of course , that , as NP VP , we have VP .
RB VB NP , i want VP .
for example , i don &apos; t want to VB NP NP .
i don NP VP .
i don NP VP .
so there are some an@@ atom@@ ical di@@ visi@@ ons that make sense to PRP and that i think NP VP .
but the challenge is trying VP and do NP VP .
so let NP VP conc@@ ei@@ ved at NP PP .
PRP VBP NP , both conc@@ ei@@ ved IN NP IN NP .
let NP VP .
NP VP , so NP VP .
RB IN NP that NP VP , she comes into NP PP NP RBR than NP : NP , NP , NP .
henry has to wait for NP PP , not because NP VP .
we find NP PP IN NP .
henry , by virtu@@ e of being as@@ sum@@ ed to be male -- although NP NP VBD NP SBAR -- by virtu@@ e of being as@@ sum@@ ed VP is now li@@ able to be dra@@ f@@ ted , which mary does not need to worry about .
mary , mean@@ while , can not in NP VP .
henry can mar@@ ry in NP NP , but mary can only mar@@ ry today in NP NP .
so we have these an@@ atom@@ ical categ@@ ories that pers@@ ist NP VP .
and the question to me becomes : what do NP VP ?
i don NP VP , but at the same time it kind of feels RB like NP VP .
RB WRB VBP NP VP ?
PRP VBZ SBAR : S , NP VP , so NP VP . &quot;
but NP PP VBP VP .
so for example , texas has at one point decided that what it means to mar@@ ry DT NN is to mean that NP VP , and WP NP VP .
now in practice they don &apos; t actually test NP PP .
but this is also very bizar@@ re , because PP NP VP .
if NP VP , he off@@ ers PRP NP PP .
he says we should ju@@ dge NP VP , but on the content of their character , &quot; moving beyond an@@ atom@@ y .
and i want to VP , VP . &quot;
but in NP , how do PRP VB NP ?
how do you ju@@ dge people based IN NP ?
i also want to point out that NP VP .
i also want to say NP VP some yellow lab@@ rad@@ ors that i know S .
so how do we oper@@ a@@ tion@@ alize NP PP ?
it turns out TO VP .
and part of me also wonder@@ s , what if content of character turns out to be something that &apos;s scan@@ n@@ able in the future -- able to be seen IN NP ?
do we RB want VP ?
i &apos;m not sure WRB NP VP .
what i do know is that it seems to be really important to think IN NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
we don NP VP .
we don NP VP .
i &apos;m gla@@ d to say NP VP .
but WRB NP VP -- NP VP -- his answer was IN , S .
NP VP , VBP NP VP ? &quot;
the united states has off@@ ered tremendous possibility for VBG NP S .
so i think NP VP .
well , just to close , i want to suggest to PRP that NP VP .
and i want to think IN NP , or might have looked like , if NP VP .
and NP VP , and NP VP .
now IN NP , because NP VP , i &apos;ve RB VBN ADJP PP .
and one of NP SBAR is looking IN NP IN NP they think and operate in the world .
and WP NP VP is IN S .
and so if NP VP , we have NP PP .
years ago , when i was in graduate school , one of my graduate ad@@ vis@@ ers who knew NP VP asked a really strange question .
he said , NP VP . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well that &apos;s the du@@ m@@ best question NP VP .
fe@@ min@@ ism is all about un@@ doing stere@@ ot@@ yp@@ es about NN , so there &apos;s nothing fe@@ min@@ ine IN NP . &quot;
but the more NP VP , the more NP VP might be ADJP PP .
that is VP , there might be NN , IN NP .
so whereas NP VP , it &apos;s possible that if NP VP .
and maybe that &apos;s WRB NP VP , WRB NP VP , is VP .
so that as we the people try TO VP , we &apos;re thinking about WP NP VP .
VBP NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
CC SBAR , NP VP , and NP VP .
PRP VBP NP , S .
but i don NP VP .
i get NP VP .
NN , VBP NP .
secon@@ d@@ hand sh@@ opp@@ ing allows NP VP .
NP VP ; NP ADVP VP ; NP VP ; and NP VP .
NP VP , what am PRP VBG S ?
is it going VP ?
will PRP VB NP ?
will it be IN NP ?
if NP VP , i feel IN IN S .
i want to get back to my su@@ it@@ case and tell you what i pac@@ ked IN NP ADVP IN NP .
i mean , what does NP VP ?
so i &apos;m going to show you RB WP NP VP .
NP VP and NP VP .
exactly one week &apos;s worth of un@@ dies is all NP VP .
i was be@@ tting that NP VP .
and since you don &apos; t know me as NP VP -- that means i found a few things .
and NP VP my week &apos;s NP PP RB RB .
does that sound JJ ?
so as i do this , i &apos;m also going to VB NP NP .
so let NP VP .
PRP VBP NP . &quot;
you do not have VP VP .
you can almost always look phenomen@@ al for IN NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
NNP : NP VP .
it is almost physi@@ ologi@@ cally impossible to be in a bad mo@@ od when you &apos;re VBG NP .
if NP VP , you are VBG S .
tu@@ es@@ day : VP VBZ NP .
i &apos;ve spent a whole lot of NP VP and at the same time fit in .
just be WP NP VP .
if NP VP , NP VP , they will VB NP .
we@@ dn@@ es@@ day : VB NP .
sometimes people tell me that i look like NP VP , or that NP VP .
NP VP , S VP . &quot;
NNP : NP VP .
if NP VP , you almost certainly do .
and if you don NP VP , you &apos;re also probably right .
i grew up with a mom who VBD NP NP .
but it wasn &apos; t until NP VP .
and i &apos;m going to break PRP RP IN NP IN NP .
if NP VP , there is DT NN IN S .
so there is NP PP RB IN NP .
we should be able to rock anything NP VP .
VBP NP .
NP : NP : NP VP .
and finally , satur@@ day : developing your own unique personal style is a really great way to tell DT NN NN IN NP IN S .
NP VP , and NP VP .
so obviously this is not NP VP .
RB before NP VP , i &apos;m VBG S .
because the lesson i &apos;m trying to learn myself this week is that NP VP .
i don NP VP .
VBP NP ADVP .
VBP NP .
JJ NN , NN .
i &apos;ve got something to VB NP .
think about this as NP , NP .
this is WP NP VP .
let NP VP .
now if you take this picture -- i &apos;m itali@@ an origin@@ ally , and every boy in NN gro@@ ws up with NP PP -- but the reason NP VP this is that NP VP .
RB NP RB , IN S , NP VP , and NP VP .
and if NP VP , then you &apos;d VB NP .
now today , if you want TO VP , actually you need also NN IN NP , has NP VP .
this is WP , PP , NP VP .
and basically , it &apos;s NP VP -- NP CC NP .
what is interesting today is that real time control systems are starting to enter IN NP .
our cities , over the past few years , just have been blan@@ ket@@ ed with NP , NP .
they &apos;re becoming IN NP .
and , as computers in open air , they &apos;re starting to respond IN NP VP .
if NP VP , actually it &apos;s DT JJ NN .
just as NP VP .
they are NP : NP .
so if we &apos;re able to do NN IN NP , that &apos;s a big deal .
IN NP , NP PP VBZ VP .
that &apos;s from NP SBAR is organi@@ zing IN NP RB NP , IN NP .
it &apos;s called NNP NN IN NP . &quot;
well our objects , our environment is starting to talk RB IN NP .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost as if every at@@ om out there were becoming DT NP CC NP .
and that is radi@@ cally changing the interaction NP VP .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost as if NP PP ...
you know , WRB NP VP ? why don NP SBAR ? &quot;
well today , for the first time , our environment is starting to talk RB IN NP .
and i &apos;ll NP NP -- PP CC VP .
VB NP PP .
well , the first project NP VP is actually CD IN NP .
PRP VBD NP PP .
and what we did there was actually use NP PP IN NP and use ADJP NN IN NP , IN S .
the summer was NP : NP .
it &apos;s WRB NP VP .
NP PP MD VP , it was NP VP .
and anyway , it@@ al@@ y won IN NP .
now look at what happened that day just by monit@@ or@@ ing NP VP .
RB PRP VBP NP .
you see the col@@ o@@ s@@ se@@ um in NP , NP .
it &apos;s NN , IN NP .
you see NP PP .
early after@@ noon , people here and there , VBG NP and VBG .
DT NN VBZ -- NP .
NNP NNS . RB NNS .
NP , NP VP CC VP .
second half . NN IN NP .
RB RB , second .
NN , NP PP .
RB NNS . yeah .
well , that night , everybody went to celebra@@ te IN NP .
PRP VBD NP .
the following day , again everybody went to the center to meet NP CC NP .
and RB NN VBD ADVP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
well , that &apos;s just one example of how we can sense the city today in a way that we couldn NP VP .
NP PP : NP VP .
well today , we know everything about WRB NP VP .
this is a map that VBZ NP NP .
but we know very little about WRB NP VP .
so in this project , we actually developed some small ta@@ gs to track tr@@ ash as NP VP .
so we actually started IN NP .
then we put NP , NP , IN NP and then started VP .
here are the results NP ADVP VP .
from NNP ...
after CD NN .
with this information we realized NP VP .
we can actually do DT JJ NN IN NP .
DT NN VBD RB ADJP ADVP .
but there &apos;s a lot of NP VP .
but the other thing is that NP VP .
and the plastic bottle NP VP sta@@ ys RB .
and if NP VP , then we can RB VB NP .
so that was NP PP .
NP , PRN NP VP , and NP VP .
and the first project is something NP VP .
it started IN NP IN NP .
and the question was : how could NP , NP , VB VP ?
and NP VP , and NP VP .
you create IN NP IN NP .
if NP VP , NP VP , you can VB NP .
and ADVP NP VP , and NP VP .
well , we pres@@ ented DT IN NP .
PRP VBD NP ADVP .
and we got a com@@ mission to design a building at NP PP .
PRP VBD NP NP .
the whole building is made IN NP .
ADVP NP , but SBAR , NP VP .
the roof also is covered IN NP .
and if NP VP , if NP VP , you can RB VB NP .
or NP VP , and NP VP , NP VP , NP-TMP , NP ADVP VP , WHADVP S . &quot;
no , NP VP , RB WRB NP VP , the architecture almost disappe@@ ars .
RB VBZ NP VP .
you see NP VP .
and RB VBD NP NP DT NN .
well , i should tell you now what happened one night when DT IN NP stopped VP .
but ADVP DT NN , PRP VBD ADVP NP .
all the kids from zar@@ a@@ go@@ za came to the building , because NP PP VBD NP S .
not ADVP NP VP , and NP VP .
and that was , IN NP , S .
but RB NN VBZ ADJP .
and that &apos;s NP PP and interact IN NP .
here is an image then of NP , NP , CC NP .
and NP VP i &apos;ll S .
that &apos;s , imagine NP VP .
imagine NP VP .
RB VBZ NP .
so imagine NP , PP , IN NP .
so you can VB NP .
you can have NP : NP .
CC PP NP , but PP , SBAR , NP VP .
you can play IN NP .
imagine NP VP .
but then the whole thing can be just a 3d cloud of pi@@ x@@ els that you can approach and move IN NP and see IN NP .
here is the real fl@@ y@@ fire control and going down to VB NP PP .
when you turn IN NP , actually you see this . so the same as we saw before .
and imagine NP VP .
you can have NP VP .
i want to VB NP NP PP .
we &apos;ve been working with ro@@ ber@@ to bol@@ le , one of today &apos;s top bal@@ let dan@@ cers -- the é@@ toi@@ le at NP PP and NP PP -- and actually cap@@ tured his movement in 3d in order to use it as NP PP .
and here you can VB NP .
you see on NP VP .
it &apos;s NP PP .
so you can VB NP .
you can VB NP PP .
but then , once NP VP , then you can VP CC VP .
so we want to use this as NP PP .
i wanted to show you the last project NP VP .
it &apos;s something NP VP .
it &apos;s VBN NP .
and the idea here is , VP , ADVP , NP VP .
imagine NP VP .
and i think what is remarkable that has happened IN NP .
this has been di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zing NP , NP , and making NP ADJP .
now today , for the first time -- and DT NN NN VBD NP NP -- we can go IN NP IN NP .
NP VP , PP , NP VP .
that means NP VP .
but tomorrow it can be , in order to t@@ ack@@ le NN NNS NP : NP : how we can go IN NP IN NP .
so the idea that NP VP .
the cloud is a cloud , again , made IN NP , IN NP .
and those particles are water , where our cloud is NP PP .
it &apos;s DT JJ NN IN NP , but covered IN NP .
NP VP , VBP NP PP .
you can actually see from underneath , sharing NP PP , and really using PRP IN NP VP .
so both the physical cloud in DT NN and something you can go to NP PP , like NP NP .
you can enter IN NP .
and NP PP .
VBP NP .
as an artist , connection is very important IN NP .
through my work i &apos;m trying to artic@@ u@@ late that NP VP and that NP VP .
i first went IN NP NP IN , WHADVP S .
i was IN NP .
my heart beat fast , my head was di@@ zz@@ y , trying to com@@ pre@@ h@@ end what it was that stood in NN IN NP .
NP VP , and NP VP , NN IN NP .
ic@@ e@@ ber@@ gs are born when they cal@@ ve IN IN NP or break RP IN NP .
DT NN VBZ NP .
they have a distin@@ ct way of inter@@ acting with NP CC NP .
some re@@ f@@ use TO VP , while NP VP .
it &apos;s easy VP , WRB NP VP , that NP VP .
but the reality is far IN NP .
as NP VP , i am VBG PP .
as NP VP , it is VBG NP .
i approach photograph@@ ing these ic@@ e@@ ber@@ gs as if NP VP , knowing that PP NP VP .
NP VP ; NP VP .
some of the ice in the ic@@ e@@ ber@@ gs WDT NP VP is very young -- a couple thousand years old .
and DT IN NP is NP JJ .
the last pictures NP VP are of NP SBAR .
it &apos;s NP SBAR .
RB RB PRP VBZ .
you can see on NP NP .
that &apos;s IN NP .
and i &apos;d like NP VP and WRB NP VP .
NP VP , NP VP , and NP VP , and DT NN VBZ VP .
DT VBZ NP .
it &apos;s NP IN NP .
and DT NN VBZ NP .
and RB IN NP , DT NN VBZ NP NP .
VBP NP .
i have had the distin@@ ct bl@@ ess@@ ing in my life to have worked IN NP .
but the cool@@ est NP ADVP VP was around this guy .
this guy &apos;s NP VP .
temp@@ t was one of NP PP .
and he came RP ADVP IN NP and said , NP , NP VP . &quot;
and that was NP PP .
ADVP VP VBZ ADVP ADJP .
he only has NN IN NP .
i was ex@@ posed IN NP .
NP VP , so ADVP NP VP .
and so we decided that NP VP .
so i went and met IN NP and said , &quot; NP VP .
what are you going to do IN NP ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; NP ADVP VP .
NP ADVP VP and NP VP ? &quot;
and NP VP , PP , SBAR , NP VP VBP NP .
these devices aren &apos; t acc@@ essi@@ ble IN NP . &quot;
and PRP VBD , RB RB , WRB VBP NP ADVP VP ? &quot;
has everyone seen NP VP ? &quot;
NP VP -- ADVP VP .
PRP VP , NP . WRB MD NP VP ? &quot;
ADVP NP VP , and ADVP , NP VP .
NP VP -- NP VP .
because NP VP . &quot;
so i spoke IN NP NP IN NP .
PRP VBD NP , and NP VP , and NP ADVP VP .
so they go RB and do NN NNS IN NP .
all the things WDT VP , they said NP VP .
ADVP NP VP , ADVP NP VP , ADVP NP VP and RB NP ADVP VP .
but there was always DT NN NN IN NP .
so i went home and was having NP PP and was telling PRP IN NP , and we were like , &quot; well wait a second . if we know that NP VP , why don &apos; t S CC S ? well that would be a@@ wes@@ ome . &quot;
so that VBD NP .
QP CD NNS later , IN NP RB , after NP CC NP , we &apos;d VBN NP .
NP , NP VP , and NP ADVP VP .
WDT VP .
and he &apos;s seriously CD IN NP -- NP VP , NP VP , and NP VP . this guy &apos;s so amazing . &quot;
the other thing NP VP is NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
NP VP and NP VP .
but PP , NP VP , NP VP , NP VP , NP VP VP , and PRP VBD NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
this is a cheap pair of sun@@ glas@@ ses that we bought at NP , NP CC NP from NP CC NP .
NP VP -- NP VP , NP VP , NP VP .
and now we &apos;ve created NP SBAR .
there NP NP WHNP S . &quot;
there NP NP WHNP S . &quot;
NP SBAR RB VBZ NP .
VBP NP .
VBP NP NP ADVP . DT VBD ADJP .
so at DT NN IN NP , we went back to VB NP .
i love this picture , because this is someone else &apos;s NP CC NP VBZ NP .
so there &apos;s all this hu@@ st@@ le and bu@@ st@@ le going on IN NP .
and after over NP , NP , NP CC NP , S .
and this is an amazing picture , because NP VP , and NP VP .
we ki@@ cked his bed so that NP VP .
and we set up a proje@@ ctor on a wall out in the par@@ king lot outside IN NP .
and NP VP -- and NP VP .
NP VP , S , so NP ADVP VP .
RB PP , NP VP , and NP VP .
NP VP , and S CC S . &quot;
NP SBAR JJ ?
so that &apos;s kind IN NP .
that &apos;s what kee@@ ps NP VP and kee@@ ps NP VP .
and we &apos;ve got such a long way to go IN NP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
and someone who has NP PP deser@@ ves so much more .
so we &apos;re IN NP .
since that time , we &apos;ve had NP PP .
we &apos;ve won NP PP .
S , NP VP ; NP VP .
it &apos;s NP VP .
so the a@@ wards were like , NP INTJ , NP VP . &quot;
arm@@ strong twi@@ tter@@ ed IN NP , and RB IN NP , time magazine hon@@ or@@ ed us as CD IN NP IN NP , WDT VP .
DT ADJP NN IN NP -- and NP VP -- is IN S . &quot;
and &quot; art of the streets &quot; is going to have NP PP -- NP , NP , NP -- NP PP VP .
temp@@ t NP VP .
so basically this is PRP$ NN : if NP VP , make NP ADJP .
NP ADJP -- NP , NP , NP , NP -- NP ADJP .
make NP ADJP , NP PP .
NP VP , but NP ADVP VP .
and NP VP you feel IN S PRN and if NP ?
VBP NP NP .
you know , WDT NP VP is NP PP , and i &apos;m NP NP , IN NP .
and i always tell people that i don NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
i &apos;m here today to talk IN NP IN NP .
and you know , NP VP .
you &apos;ve just got to go IN NP VP .
that &apos;s NP PP .
DT NN IN NP did NP : NP .
it &apos;s NP RB NP SBAR .
my circle began back IN NP in NP PP WRB NP VP .
i was NP VP .
she saved my life by le@@ tting NP VP .
she did PRP IN NP .
she did PRP IN NP .
and i had to get IN IN NP .
NP VP , NP VP , and NP VP .
about three or four years ago , i got a phone call in NP PP from NP , NP , WHNP S , &quot; PRP VBP S .
i &apos;m dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted that NP ADVP VP .
could you please come to o@@ hi@@ o , and please bring that man that i know NP VP .
and i should mention that NP VP , and NP VP . &quot;
well , the next day we were IN NP .
NP VP , NP VP , NP VP , and NP VP .
NP VP , NP VP , and NP VP .
it &apos;s something NP VP .
and just as DT NN WHNP S got VP , she turned into NP PP and was placed IN NP .
and what had happened was NP SBAR , it had become a circle -- and that epi@@ ph@@ any NP VP pres@@ ented itself .
the epi@@ ph@@ any is that NP VP .
she saved NP VP .
and you know , NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
PRP RB VBZ -- NP VP , and NP VP .
VBP NP .
imagine a big explosion as NP VP .
imagine NP PP .
imagine NP PP .
it sounds JJ .
well i had NP NP . i was VBG PP .
i was the only one who could talk IN NP .
ADVP NP VP , and NP VP . PRP RB VBD NP . &quot;
NP VP , and NP VP .
you could VB NP .
CD NNS later , three things happened IN NP .
the pilot lines up DT NN IN NP .
DT NNS RB RB DT NN .
PRP VBZ PRT NP .
now imagine being IN NP .
and then he says CD NNS -- NP NP VP .
NP VP , ADVP VP . &quot;
i didn NP VP .
NP VP , PRP VBD NP . NN VBD ADVP .
now i want to share with you three things NP VP .
i learned that NP VP .
NP VP , NP VP , and S CC S .
as NP VP , i came RP IN NP . &quot;
because if NP VP and NP VP , i &apos;m VBG NP .
i no longer want to post@@ po@@ ne NN IN NP .
and that ur@@ gen@@ cy , that NP , has really changed PRP$ NN .
the second thing NP VP -- and NP VP -- NP VP , wow , i really feel one real re@@ gre@@ t .
i &apos;ve VBD NP .
in my own humanity and mistakes , i &apos;ve tried to get better at everything NP VP .
but IN NP , PRP RB VBP NP S .
and i re@@ gre@@ tt@@ ed the time NP VP .
and i thought IN NP IN NP , IN NP , IN NP .
and after , as NP VP , i decided VP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
i &apos;ve not had DT NN IN NP IN NP .
it feels JJ .
NP ADVP VP ; NP VP .
the third thing NP VP -- and NP VP , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 . &quot;
you can see NP VP .
i &apos;m saying , NP INTJ VP . &quot;
i don NP VP .
and as NP VP , i had NP PP .
it &apos;s almost like we &apos;ve been prepar@@ ing for NP NP .
but it was RB JJ .
NP VP ; NP VP .
and that sa@@ dness really fra@@ med IN NP .
i only wish NP VP .
IN NP RB , i was IN NP -- NP , RB NP ...
... RB .
and i &apos;m ba@@ w@@ ling , S , IN NP .
and it made PDT DT NN IN NP IN NP .
i realized at DT NN , by VP , that NP VP .
above all , above all , the only goal NP VP is to VB NP .
i was VBN NP .
i was VBN NP .
i challenge NP NP , and how would you change ?
what would you get done that you &apos;re waiting to get done because you think NP NP ?
how would you change NP CC NP IN NP ?
and more than anything , are you being the best par@@ ent NP VP ?
VBP NP .
DT NN IN NP is RB RB JJ .
we don NP VP .
NP PP VBZ NP .
NP SBAR , DT VBP NP .
now if PRP VBP S , we can actually cause NP PP IN NP .
NP VP ; NP VP .
but if NP VP , then we are IN NP .
and this is NP PP .
so we start IN NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
NP RB , UH ?
i want to tell you WRB NP VP .
when we started our research on NN six months ago , it was completely un@@ known what DT NN IN NP was .
NP VP VBZ ADJP PP NP , NP .
and it seemed to want to do something with NP , NP .
so that VBD NP , and we started a lab project WRB NP VP .
and then some RB JJ things happened .
NP VP , but NP VP .
didn &apos; t make NN IN NP .
and after NP VP , i realized , INTJ , NP VP .
PRP VBZ ADJP .
the dro@@ pp@@ er is pro@@ w@@ ling ac@@ tively on the gra@@ y box if NP VP , and even if NP VP .
and SBAR , NP VP .
so that really got my attention , and we started to work on NP NP , because i thought , &quot; well , we don &apos; t know WP NP VP .
it could be , let &apos;s say IN NP IN NP .
so we better find out WP NP VP . &quot;
ADVP NP VP , and NP VP .
and we also saw that NP VP .
they knew all the bits and bit@@ es that NP VP .
they probably even know DT NN NN IN NP .
RB PRP VBP NP .
and if NP VP , let NP VP : the pay@@ load is NN NN .
it &apos;s NN IN NP .
here you see NP PP .
we are talking about -- around NP PP .
looks RB RB IN NP .
and i want to tell you how we were able to make sense out IN NP .
so what PRP VBD VP , system function calls , because NP VP .
and then we were looking IN NP and trying VP .
so we do need target theor@@ ies WDT NP VP .
in order TO VP , we remember that NP VP , NP VP and NP VP .
now you don NP VP .
it basically bo@@ ils down IN NP and IN NP .
so i told my assi@@ stant , NN VB NP NP . &quot;
and i ph@@ oned them up and picked their brain in an effort to match their exper@@ ti@@ se with what we found IN NP .
and that worked RB RB .
so we were able to VB NP PP .
the ro@@ tor is that moving NN IN NP .
and if you manipu@@ late the speed of this ro@@ tor , you are actually able to cra@@ ck DT NN and eventually even have NP VP .
what we also saw is that DT NN IN NP was RB VP .
the big digital war@@ head -- we had DT NN IN NP by VP .
ADVP , NP ADVP VP ; NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
so NP VP , that was DT NN .
and PRP RB VBD ADJP .
these cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ges in NN are sub@@ divi@@ ded IN NP .
and VB SBAR we found IN NP ?
an RB JJ structure .
RB RB , DT VBD NP .
and DT VBD NP NP .
RB VB S , it didn NP VP .
these results have been ob@@ tain@@ ed IN NP .
and we often went IN NP and had VP .
anyway , so we figured out that NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
so in all , we are very confi@@ dent that NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
so we don NP VP .
RB &apos;s NP SBAR -- RB VBD NP ADVP .
ADVP NP VP , and PP NP VP .
ADVP SBAR VP -- and NP VP .
and as DT NN IN NP , this fa@@ ke input data is actually pr@@ er@@ e@@ cor@@ ded IN NP .
so it &apos;s just like from the hollywood movies where during the hei@@ st , the obser@@ vation camera is f@@ ed IN NP .
DT VBZ S , INTJ ?
the idea here is obviously not only to VB NP PP .
it actually is ADVP JJ CC JJ .
the idea is to VB NP .
we need digital safety systems WRB NP VP .
so IN NP , in DT NN NN , WRB NP VP , you must VB NP PP .
obviously , this can not be done IN NP .
so this is WRB NP VP .
and WRB NP VP , then RB JJ things can VB .
PRP$ NN MD VP .
and CC NP CC NP MD VP .
that &apos;s JJ .
but PRP VBZ ADJP .
and this is very important , WP NP VP .
VP : NP VP .
it doesn NP VP .
so it would work as well , for NN , IN NP or IN NP .
it is JJ .
and you don S -- as an attac@@ ker -- you don NP VP .
you could also use conven@@ tional wor@@ m technology for VP .
RB VB NP PP .
and if NP VP is NP PP .
that &apos;s the con@@ sequence WDT NP VP .
so unfortunately , DT JJS NN IN NP are not IN NP .
they &apos;re IN NP and IN NP .
ADVP NP , DT VBP NP .
NP VP , and NP ADVP VP .
thanks .
i &apos;ve VBD NP .
r@@ al@@ ph , it &apos;s been quite wid@@ ely repor@@ ted that NP VP .
is DT PRP$ NN ?
okay , you really want to VB NP ?
yeah . okay .
my opini@@ on is that NP VP , but that NP VP .
RB NP PP VBZ NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
IN ADVP , PRP$ NNS MD ADVP VP .
VBP NP PP . VBP NP , NP .
i have spent the past few years putting myself IN NP and IN NP .
i went IN NP .
i worked IN NP .
i fil@@ med IN NP .
and i spent 30 days eating NN IN NP -- NN IN NP , little difficult in NP , ADJP IN NP .
in NP , NP , i &apos;ve VBN VP .
so when i knew i was coming here to VB NP , i knew i would want to do something NP JJ .
so as NP VP , a couple weeks ago , i took out DT NN IN NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
NP VP , NP VP , NP ADVP VP and NP ADVP VP .
RB WHNP S VBD NP : PRP$ NN RB VBZ : NP and , depen@@ ding IN NP , could RB VB PRT PP , especially if NP VP or NP VP .
but that being said , NP VP .
you know WRB JJ NP VP ?
PRP VBZ NP .
that &apos;s NP , PP .
so even with DT NN , i knew that NP VP .
now if you &apos;d have asked me that a year ago , i wouldn NP VP .
but in the new project WDT NP VP , we exam@@ ine the world of NP , NP .
and SBAR , NP VP , but NP VP .
NP VP , PRP VBD NP .
what i want VP is make a film all IN NP .
so the movie will be called &quot; NP VP . &quot;
so what VBZ PP NP , &quot; is that NP VP .
RB NP , NP , NP ...
these people will be married IN NP .
and so the film explor@@ es DT JJ NN -- NP VP in per@@ pe@@ tu@@ ity , forever ?
PRP VBP NP .
that was JJR IN NP .
PRP VP , NP . forever . &quot;
but not only are we going to have the brand x ti@@ tle spon@@ sor , but we &apos;re going to make sure NP VP in the film .
ADVP NP VP and NP VP ...
NP SBAR , VB NP S . &quot;
so the idea is , beyond just showing that NP VP , but actually get them to fin@@ ance the film ?
and actually we show NP PP .
NP PP VBZ NP .
you &apos;re going to see NP VP .
so that &apos;s NP VP .
and i would love for ce@@ g to help make NP VP .
you know NP VP .
i don NP VP .
do you have a perspective -- i don NP VP ?
how much money does it take VP ?
CD CD .
NP VP , but NP VP .
who knows , maybe by the time NP VP , we look like a bunch of bli@@ ther@@ ing i@@ di@@ ots .
what do you think NP VP ?
the respon@@ ses mostly will be VBN NP . &quot;
but is it a tough sell because IN NP or DT JJ NN because of me ?
NNP : DT .
... VP RB RB JJ .
RB , NN , can PRP VB NP ? PRP MD VP .
i can VB NP .
okay .
a@@ wes@@ ome .
we &apos;ve got ta figure RP NP NP .
yeah .
SBAR NP VP . .
we &apos;ve got some places NP VP .
VB NP PRT .
i thought NP VP , &quot; let NP VP . &quot;
turns out it really means , &quot; NP VP . &quot;
and just like NP , NP , DT IN NP suddenly disappe@@ ared .
NP PP VBD NP S .
i was JJ .
they wanted absolutely nothing to do IN NP .
and i was blo@@ wn away , because i thought NP , NP , VBD S , to get as many people to VB NP PP .
especially in NP NP , NP PP and NP NP ?
no , that &apos;s WP NP VP .
but the problem was , PRP VBP , NP VP , and that NP VP .
ADVP NP , DT VBD RB NP .
that wouldn &apos; t have VBN NP ADVP .
this would VB VP .
but WP NP VP was DT NN .
see , WRB NP VP , NP VP -@@ -- this is NP PP .
RB PRP IN NP PRP VBP , NP . no .
this is VBD NP .
NP VP , PRP VBP NP .
NP VP , NP VP , ADVP NP VP .
but suddenly WRB NP VP , something suddenly changes .
but why ? well , transpar@@ ency is JJ -- IN NP .
it &apos;s JJ -- IN NP .
and it &apos;s RB RB JJ .
what else is JJ ?
eating NP PP .
DT NNS RB JJ .
now when i started talking to companies and telling them that NP VP , and NP VP , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
NP VP , but NP ADVP VP . &quot;
see , when PRP VBD NP and NP VP -- and ADVP NP VP -- NP VP , &quot; son , there &apos;s three sides to every story .
RB VB NP , there VBZ NP and RB VBZ NP . &quot;
now you see , with DT NN , NP VP .
but IN NP , NP ADJP -- and NP VP -- NP VP , NP VP .
so what you suddenly started VP -- or WP NP VP -- is IN S .
NP VP , and NP VP .
and the friends of mine who make NP VP is because of the brand part@@ ners that they have .
and then my friends who make NP VP , &quot; well , how are we supposed TO VP ? &quot;
and the movie is called NP VP . &quot;
so how specifically will we see NN IN NP ?
NP-TMP NP VP , NP-TMP NP VP , NP VP .
while any@@ time NP VP , NP VP , NN are PRP JJ RB IN NP ?
are you ready ? you look NP JJ .
i want to help NP VP .
so maybe you should VB NP PP . &quot;
so we &apos;ll NP PP .
whether it &apos;s a &quot; NP , VP have their chance .
we will have NP VP .
DT VBZ NP .
so now i can VB NP and VB NP NP .
PRP VBP NP .
much like NP VP , we &apos;re very much a challen@@ ger brand .
so we don NP VP .
ADVP VP -- NP VP .
what are the words that you would use VP ?
NN VBZ ADJP .
DT VBZ NP .
super@@ ior technology .
technology &apos;s not the way NP VP .
PRP VBP PP , S .
i think &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that really sp@@ ins NP PP , versus NP NP . &quot;
it kee@@ ps NP ADJP .
WRB VBP NP VP -- NP , NP .
things like that NP VP of that positive benefit .
and DT VBZ NP .
WP IN NP ? WP IN NP ?
i need to go talk to the man on NP , NP , the regular jo@@ es .
they need to tell PRP IN NP .
WRB MD NP VP ?
UH , PRP$ NN ?
i don NP VP .
PRP VBP NP .
80 &apos;s re@@ vi@@ val me@@ ets skater - punk , unless NP VP .
all right , what is NN NN ?
unique .
i guess what kind of NP , NP would be IN NP .
i like NP , NP CC NP .
but ADVP NP VP , or NP VP .
if NP VP , he might VB NP .
the brand WDT NP VP is , NP VP .
NP , NP -- NP VP .
PRP VBP NP .
i sell pet to@@ ys RB IN NP , all IN NP .
so i guess NP VP .
IN NP , DT VBZ NP .
my brand is fe@@ de@@ x because NP VP .
VBD NP .
is DT NN ?
PRP VBP NP .
PRP VBP NP .
INTJ NP VP , but NP VP .
and WDT NP VP is S .
i needed somebody who could get inside NP , NP . &quot;
and so i found NP VP .
they &apos;ve helped NP VP .
if NP VP , sur@@ ely they could VB NP PP .
NP VP , ADJP ?
i did . the very first picture is DT NN IN NP .
so tell me a little bit WRB NP VP .
these are the people who shape the way NP VP .
tell PRP IN NP .
this world ? i think your world is the world that NP VP -- like people who are IN NP you do .
NP VP , and PP NP VP .
what &apos;s the next one NP VP ?
DT JJ CD : NP VP .
how does this rel@@ ate to your thoughts and feelings about WP NP VP ?
NP VP , who do PRP VBP S ?
i like NP SBAR .
PRP VBP NP . PRP VBP NP .
tell PRP IN NP -- what does that do IN NP ?
WP VBZ NP ? WP NP VP ?
why is it important IN NP ? what does the red represent ?
VB NP NP .
... a little more about you that is not WP NP VP .
what are some other me@@ tam@@ or@@ pho@@ ses WDT NP VP had ?
... NP NP VBP S . WHNP PP VBP NP PP ?
ee@@ ee@@ e@@ e ! UH , VBP NP .
NP PP NN .
yeah . all right .
yeah , i don NP VP .
there was NP VP .
NP VP -- NP VP .
DT VBP VP .
and i think there &apos;s almost DT NN IN NP .
and i think NP VP .
most companies tend VP , and PRP RB VBP NP , and NP ADVP VP , and NP VP .
NP VBP PP ?
NP PP VBZ NP .
and you can see NP , NP , NP , CC NP .
now ADVP VP NP and ADJP NP , but DT ADJP NN VBZ NP .
a JJ , JJ brand . WP VBZ NP ?
if NN VBD NP S , your brand person@@ ality , what would you be ?
are you an up at@@ tribu@@ te ? are you something that gets NP VP ?
or are you JJR IN NP ?
are you something that &apos;s NP ADJP ?
up at@@ tribu@@ tes are NP PP .
or are you JJR IN NP ?
are you ADJP , ADJP IN NP ?
are PRP VP , VP ?
are you reli@@ able , stable , familiar , safe , sec@@ ure , sac@@ red , con@@ temp@@ la@@ tive or wise like NP CC NP ?
over NP PP , we had NP SBAR .
they wanted nothing to do IN NP , main@@ ly because they would VB NP , they would have no control over the final product .
but we did get 17 brand part@@ ners who were willing to VB NP and who ultimately em@@ powered us to tell NP : NP .
they en@@ ab@@ led us to tell the story about neuro@@ marketing , as we got into telling the story in this film about how now they &apos;re using mr@@ i &apos;s to target NP PP IN NP .
we went to san pau@@ l@@ o where they have VBN NP .
PP , NP VP , NP VP , NP VP .
and we went IN NP WHADVP S .
what &apos;s incredible for me is the projects that NP VP , or NP VP had the most success in , are ones where i &apos;ve inter@@ ac@@ ted with things directly .
and that &apos;s WP NP VP .
NP VP , NP VP , NP VP .
i &apos;m going to deal RB IN NP .
i &apos;m going to work IN NP VP . &quot;
and how has that been IN NP ? has it been successful ?
well , since NP VP , let NP VP .
VBG PP , NP VP -- and NP VP .
that &apos;s literally co@@ vering RB IN NP .
NP VP -- NP , NP .
NP NP even VBN VP .
it &apos;s not RB JJ . it &apos;s RB ADVP VP .
it &apos;s NP VP .
so ultimately , this film has already started to gain NP PP .
and not bad for a project that almost every ad agen@@ cy NP VP ad@@ vis@@ ed their cli@@ ents not TO VP .
what i always believe is that if you take chan@@ ces , if NP VP .
i believe that WRB NP VP , you &apos;re VP .
i believe that WRB NP VP , then you &apos;re VP .
i feel like NP VP .
we need to encoura@@ ge people to not be afraid IN NP .
ultimately , moving RB , i think NP VP .
we &apos;ve got to put DT NN IN NP .
embra@@ ce fear . embra@@ ce risk .
one big spo@@ on@@ ful at a time , we have to VB NP .
and ultimately , we have to VB NP .
today , more than ever , a little hon@@ est@@ y is going to VB NP .
and DT VBG VP , IN NP , NP , NP VBZ VP , WP IN NP .
turning JJ NNS IN NP IN NP .
NP VP : JJ NN NN . &quot;
VBP NP ADVP , NP .
so , mor@@ gan , in DT NN IN NP , what exactly happened IN NP ?
DT VBZ NP .
NP VP -- NP VP .
my name is JJ .
and NP IN , PRP VBD NP , and NP VP , and NP VP .
and PRP VBD NP-TMP .
DT NN IN NP , i can VB NP , PP .
but i &apos;m going to focus IN NP .
there are NP PP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
and i grew RP IN NP .
NP VP -- NP VP -- but NP VP .
and so WRB NP VP , i started VP .
and while working IN NP , i tried to VB NP S .
ADVP NP VP , and NP VP .
i &apos;m going to probably get into the dem@@ o and then tell you a couple of the interesting things NP VP .
so , simple : you come IN NP .
you look RB IN NP RB .
you &apos;ve VBD NP , you &apos;ve got NP , NP , NP , NP .
i &apos;m going to actually get IN NP IN NP .
NP .
VP , VP , you &apos;re IN NP .
it doesn &apos; t matter where you are -- NP , NP , it doesn &apos; t really matter .
NP VP , PRP VBP NP .
you want to navi@@ gate IN NP ?
open the plan up , and , in NP , NP .
you &apos;re in there , you want to go IN NP .
keep VP . have NN .
VB .
thanks . i haven NP VP .
so now i &apos;m IN NP , VP IN NP .
i see NP CC NP .
if NP VP , you click IN NP .
now this is NP PP .
so this is NP PP .
PP , NP VP -- but NP VP .
and this is NP PP .
ADVP NP VP , PRP VBP , NP .
and i get a lot of people asking me : &quot; what do you get IN NP ? &quot;
so i &apos;m going to try and show you what you really get IN NP .
PRP MD VP .
you see NP VP .
NP VP ; NP VP .
but then you really want VP .
and ADVP NP VP , and NP VP .
and i was UH , NP IN . that sounds JJ . &quot;
VP , and NP VP .
i did DT JJ NN , spoke IN NP IN NP , WDT VP .
and appar@@ ently it was RB JJ .
NP VP , but NP VP .
now just VP , you can really get IN NP .
now just to give you some perspective , i &apos;m going to zo@@ om out so NP ADVP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
the best is yet to come -- RB IN NP .
so now let &apos;s just quickly jump into DT NN , again IN NP .
RB NP PP , VB NP . &quot;
now the example i showed NP VP .
but what if NP VP ?
and what if you want VP ?
you zo@@ om IN . you really go RB .
NP VP , and NP VP .
this is &quot; the star@@ ry night , &quot; NP VP , never seen like this before .
i &apos;m going to VB NP NP .
there NP NP IN NP , but i don S .
DT VBZ NP . PRP VBZ NP .
any NP PP , anybody -- NP SBAR -- NP NP .
you can VP : VP .
very simply , you go in -- and i &apos;ve created NP , VP -- you can just zo@@ om around .
this is &quot; NP , NP .
you can an@@ not@@ ate DT NN , send PRP IN NP and really get NP VP .
so i think , IN NP , IN NP , the main thing is that NP ADVP VP .
it doesn &apos; t , in my opini@@ on , even come IN NP .
i probably shouldn NP VP .
it really comes IN NP .
and that &apos;s been NP PP .
i mean , i hope in this digital medium WDT NP VP .
and the biggest question i get asked no@@ wa@@ days is , &quot; did you do NP VP ? &quot;
and DT NN VBZ NP .
it &apos;s to VB NP .
and DT VBZ NP . VBP NP .
VBP NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
there &apos;s the left half , which VBZ NP .
and so if NP VP , then we can VB NP .
and for NN , this would VB NP .
this would be NP SBAR .
so where would you put PRP$ NN IN NP ?
NP VP , but NP VP , your brain is NP PP : PP .
it &apos;s not like NP VP .
PRP MD VP .
and RB PRP VBP NP NP .
but at the same time , we need a good deal of intuition to actually make NP VP .
how do we develop this intuition ? well we like to play IN NP .
RB PRP VP CC VP , and ADVP NP VP , and ADVP NP VP .
and RB PRP VBP NP .
so some intuition WDT NP VP is that NP VP .
NP VP , S , CC S , NP VP .
and i remember watching DT JJ NN IN NP .
NP VP and NP VP , and PRP VBD S .
but i bet S VP , and that NP VP , and that NP VP .
and so this is a great concep@@ tual model TO VP , unless NP VP .
it &apos;d be DT JJ NN IN NP , because NP VP , they play with these little weird particles .
and SBAR , NP VP , or NP VP .
and ADVP NP VP , and NP VP .
and so that &apos;s WRB NP VP ; you needed quant@@ um mechan@@ ics to VB NP .
but you didn NP VP .
NP ADVP VP , and ADVP NP VP .
well , i play IN NP RB , CC ADVP ADVP .
and i &apos;ve RB VBN NP .
NP VP , NN VBZ ADVP VP .
but it didn NP VP .
because if everything is made up of NP CC NP follow quant@@ um mechan@@ ics , then shouldn &apos; t everything just follow quant@@ um mechan@@ ics ?
i don NP VP .
and so i &apos;d feel a lot JJR IN NP if NP VP .
so a few years ago , i set off to VB NP .
RB PRP VBD NP .
this is the first object that you can see NP VP .
so WP NP VP is DT JJ NN NN .
and you can sort of see DT NN NN NN IN NP .
and that &apos;s this piece of metal i &apos;m going to be talking about IN NP .
this is NP PP .
and here i &apos;ll NN IN NP . we &apos;re VP .
and then here &apos;s NP PP .
RB WHNP S VBZ NP , and NP VP , and NP VP .
and so i made DT NN IN NP IN S .
i went IN NP IN NP , and then i just c@@ ran@@ ked RB IN NP .
for the last stuff , i had to VB NP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
here , let NP VP .
you know how un@@ comfortable it is to be IN NP ?
NP VP , S , CC S and NP VP .
so quant@@ um mechan@@ ics says that NP VP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
and so we knew , if we wanted to see NP VP , we &apos;re going to have to VB PRT NP .
and so that &apos;s WP NP VP .
NP VP , and S , CC S .
and RB PRP VBD NP .
we found NP VP .
instead of just sitting perfectly still , it was vi@@ br@@ ating , and the way NP VP was brea@@ thing NN IN NP -- IN S and contra@@ cting bel@@ lo@@ ws .
and by VBG NP NP , we were able VP .
so WP NP VP is NP ADJP .
what does it mean for one thing to be NP VP ?
so let NP VP .
RB PP : NP VP and PP NP VP .
now it &apos;s only at pre@@ cise times WRB NP VP .
NP PP PRP VBP VP .
that means that NP VP .
i think NP VP .
RB .
it was worth lo@@ cking myself in a clean room to do this for all those years because , check this out , the difference in NN IN NP and that NP VP .
so if a single at@@ om can be IN NP , IN NP can be in two different places , then why not you ?
NP VP , DT VBZ ADVP NP .
so imagine if NP VP , what would that be like ?
how would your consciousness hand@@ le your body being del@@ oc@@ alized IN NP ?
ADVP NP NP PP .
NP VP , and NP VP , we saw IN S .
and so NP VP quant@@ um objects just cra@@ mm@@ ed IN NP .
you hear a lot of talk about how quant@@ um mechan@@ ics says that NP VP .
well , that &apos;s not RB JJ .
NP VP ; NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
VBP NP .
in 2007 , i decided that NP VP .
our new goal should be that when every family thinks about where they want to live and work , they should be able to choose between at least a hand@@ ful of different cities that were NP VP .
now we &apos;re a long way away IN NP right now .
there are billions of people in developing countries who don NP VP .
but the amazing thing about cities is they &apos;re worth so much more than NP VP .
so we could easily supply the world with NP , NP , IN NP .
now this might sound pre@@ po@@ ster@@ ous IN NP if NP VP .
but just sub@@ stit@@ ute NN NN IN NP .
VP VBD NP ; NP NP RB RB .
you could try and exp@@ and the capacity by doing NP PP .
but you know what you &apos;d run into VBZ NP and NP VP .
so it &apos;s extremely hard to do NP PP .
but you could go out some@@ place brand new , build a brand new a@@ partment building , as long as the rules there were ones that facili@@ t@@ ated construction rather than getting IN NP .
so i pro@@ posed that NP VP .
later i learned that at about this same time , ja@@ vier and oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o were thinking IN NP IN NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
IN NP , NN VP , VP , VP ? &quot;
in NP PP , hon@@ dur@@ as went IN NP .
at DT JJ ADJP NN , pe@@ pe lo@@ bo won IN NP IN NP .
he asked oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o to be NP PP .
mean@@ while , i was getting ready to give DT NN IN NP .
through NP , NP , i tried VP .
the first point was NP PP , IN NP .
PRP VBP NP PP , but NP VP , and NP VP .
in NP PP , DT NN IN NP sent RB DT NN IN NP .
he showed PRP IN NP .
PRP VBD NP .
NP VP , NN VBD S . &quot;
so IN NP we met IN NP , IN NP .
i tried to explain this point about WHADJP S , how much more valuable they are than NP VP .
and i used this slide showing how valuable the ra@@ w land is in NP : NP .
but NP VP , and PP , NP VP . &quot;
NP VP , NP VP and ADVP NP SBAR .
ADVP NP VP , NP VP , NP VP .
i was asked to come IN NP and talk RB IN NP .
so i pres@@ ented another fact - filled lec@@ ture that inclu@@ ded DT NN IN NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
DT NN RB VBZ NP .
ADVP NP VP , SBAR , NP VP .
that &apos;s NP NP .
NN VBD ADVP .
NP PP VBD ADJP .
NP VP , but ADVP NP VP .
i &apos;ve VP . &quot;
ADVP NP VP , and NP VP .
and it got IN NP .
there would be a choice of a city which you could go to which could be IN NP , instead IN NP away IN NP .
and it also involved JJ NNS IN NP .
because the leaders in the government there in hon@@ dur@@ as would need help from partner countries , who could benefit from partner countries who help them set up the rules in NP CC NP , so everybody can trust that the char@@ ter really will be en@@ forced .
and the insi@@ ght of NN NN was that NP VP .
we went and looked IN NP .
DT NN NNS IN NP .
it easily could VB NP .
and shor@@ tly there@@ after , on janu@@ ary 19@@ th , they vot@@ ed in the con@@ gress to am@@ end their const@@ it@@ ution to have a const@@ it@@ u@@ tional pro@@ vision that allows IN NP .
IN NP , NP PP VBD NP .
NP , NP , VBD NP .
to be NN IN NP , you actually have to pass PRP RB IN NP .
on febru@@ ary 17@@ th they passed it again with NP PP .
RB after DT NN , on NP PP , DT NN IN NP went IN NP IN NP .
CD VBZ NP .
this is DT NN IN NP WHNP S -- bigger IN NP .
everything you see NP VP .
the other place that &apos;s very interested IN NP is sing@@ apo@@ re .
they &apos;ve actually built CD NNS RB IN NP and are VBG NP .
RB if NP VP , here &apos;s WHADVP S .
NP VP ; NP VP .
they &apos;re putting IN NP NP SBAR .
one country has already volunte@@ ered to let NP VP .
there NP PP WHNP S .
they even can bring IN NP DT NN .
but the one thing NP VP is that NP VP .
there &apos;s lots of NP SBAR &apos;s NNS IN NP .
around the world , there &apos;s 700 million people who say NP VP .
there &apos;s a million a year who leave la@@ tin america to go IN NP .
NP PP VBP NP .
sa@@ dly , sometimes there are even children who are trying to get re@@ united with their parents that PRP NP VP .
so what kind of an idea is it to think about building NP PP ?
or VP ?
what kind of an idea is it to think about insi@@ sting that NP VP ?
this is NP JJ VP .
and NP PP VBD NP S .
do you know how many choices you make IN NP ?
do you know how many choices you make IN NP ?
i recently did a survey with NP , CC NP that NP VP .
there was also recently a study done with ce@@ os in which they followed ce@@ os around IN NP .
and these scientists simply docum@@ ented all the various tas@@ ks that these ce@@ os enga@@ ged in and how much time they spent eng@@ aging in making NP VP .
and they found that NP VP .
each task was made up of NP PP .
NP PP VBD VP .
NP IN NP did PRP VB NP .
think IN NP .
do you know how many choices make it into NP CC NP ?
how well do you think NP VP ?
today i want to talk about one of NP VP .
i want to talk about NP CC NP .
SBAR , NP VP and NP VP .
so when PRP VBP NP NP , since PRP VBP ADJP , only raise your hand if NP VP .
RB , WRB NP VP , and if NP VP are you guys ready to VB PP ?
VBP NP .
so when i was DT NN NN IN NP , i used to go IN NP ; at least at that time it was truly up@@ scale .
it was NP VP .
now this store , it was almost like going IN NP .
NP VP -- and NP VP .
NP VP , but PP NP ADVP VP ?
RB VB NP .
they had over 75 different kinds of o@@ live oil , including those that were IN NP .
RB NP NP-TMP VP , and NP VP , &quot; is NP PP ? &quot;
and he poin@@ ted IN NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
RB VB NP .
they had NP PP .
we set up a little ta@@ sting bo@@ oth right near DT NN IN NP .
NP ADVP VP , and NP VP ?
more people stopped when there were 24 , about 60 percent , than when there were NP , NP .
the next thing NP VP is IN WHNP NP VP .
RB PRP VBP NP .
IN NP , NP PP RB VBD NP .
of the people who stopped WRB NP VP , well now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a j@@ ar of NN .
now if you do the math , people were at least six times more likely to buy DT NN IN NP if NP VP .
now choo@@ sing RB VP is probably good IN NP -- at least it &apos;s good IN NP -- but it turns out that NP VP .
we choose not to choose , even when it goes against NP HYPH NP .
so now for DT NN IN NP : financial sav@@ ings .
now i &apos;m going to describe to you a study NP VP .
and what we looked at was whether NP PP VBP , NP , does that affect people &apos;s li@@ ke@@ li@@ hood VP .
and WP NP VP was IN S .
so IN NP , we had NP SBAR .
and what we found was that , NP VP , indeed , there was less participa@@ tion rate .
so if you look at NP , NP , participa@@ tion rates were around in the mi@@ d-@@ 7@@ 0s -- still not as high as we want NP VP .
in those plans WDT VP , participa@@ tion rates have now dro@@ pped to IN NP .
now it turns out that SBAR , NP VP .
so for those people who VBD VP , the more choices available , the more likely people were to completely avoid NP CC NP .
the more choices available , the more likely they were to VB NP PP .
now nei@@ ther of these extreme decisions are the kinds of decisions that NP VP .
UH , IN NP , PRP VBP VP .
they &apos;re more likely to del@@ ay choo@@ sing -- pro@@ cra@@ stin@@ ate even when it goes against NP HYPH NP .
they &apos;re more likely to make NP : NP .
they &apos;re more likely VP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
so what i want to pro@@ pose to PRP today are four simple techniques -- techniques that we have te@@ sted IN NP IN NP -- that you can easily apply in your businesses .
DT JJ : NN .
NP VP , but NP VP .
people are always up@@ set WRB NP VP , &quot; NN . &quot;
they &apos;re always worried NP VP .
but in fact , what we &apos;re seeing more and more is that if NP VP , there &apos;s NP PP , there is an impro@@ vement of the choo@@ sing experience .
WRB NP : NP VP , they saw DT NN IN NP IN NP .
WRB NP VP , they saw NP PP IN NP .
NP VP , DT JJ NN NN NN VBZ NP NP .
DT JJ NNP NN VBZ NP NP .
but NP VP , and NP VP .
now in the financial sav@@ ings world , i think one of the best examples that has recently come out on how to NP VP .
every single harvard employe@@ e is now auto@@ matically en@@ roll@@ ed IN NP .
IN NP , PRP VBP VP .
you know , ADVP , NP VP , &quot; NP VP .
PRP VBP NP . &quot;
and the first thing NP VP is S .
and if NP VP tell PRP RB , nei@@ ther can your consum@@ ers . &quot;
RB before NP VP , i had NP PP .
and g@@ ary said that NP VP .
here &apos;s DT NN IN NP .
and i &apos;d like NP VP .
and now i &apos;ll VB NP NP S and then i want PRP IN NP your hands if NP VP .
okay . anybody who &apos;s ready to take PRP RP IN NP .
is DT DT ?
all right , let NP VP .
you guys knew NP VP .
now who &apos;s ready to go IN NP .
i think NP VP .
all right .
now in fact , you had obje@@ c@@ tively NP NP around IN NP around , but i would vent@@ ure VP .
because NP VP .
which brings me to NP PP .
NP PP , IN NP .
why do people spend an average of 15 to 30 percent more when they use an at@@ m card or a credit card as op@@ posed IN NP ?
because NP VP feel IN NP .
and it turns out that making it feel more con@@ cre@@ te can actually be a very positive tool to use in getting people to VB NP .
so a study that i did PP , NP VP -- employees that are all working IN S -- and now these people were all in a s@@ ession where they &apos;re doing NN IN NP .
and PP , NP VP , but NP VP .
NP SBAR VBD NP S .
by VBG NP , there was NP PP IN NP and NP VP account IN NP .
DT JJ NN : NN .
we can hand@@ le more categ@@ ories than NP VP .
so for example , here &apos;s a study NP VP .
it turns out that in NP ADVP , the magazine a@@ is@@ les range ADJP NP NP .
but PRP VBP SBAR ?
if PRP VBP NP NP and NP VP , versus NP VP , you believe that PRP VBP VP .
because NP VP .
RB VBP NP .
NP VP and NP VP . &quot;
IN S VBZ NP is NN , NP NP .
UH , RB VBZ NP .
IN S VBZ NP is NN , NP NP .
UH , NP RBR .
now it turns out NP VP .
NP PP VBZ NP and NP PP VBZ NP , but you know WHNP ?
DT VBZ NP .
the categ@@ ories need to say something to NP , RB NP .
and you often see that problem when it comes down to NP PP .
WP VBP NP VP ?
my fourth techni@@ que : NN IN NP .
it turns out we can actually hand@@ le a lot more information than we think NP VP , we &apos;ve just got to take it a little easier .
we have VP .
i &apos;m going to VB NP NP .
let NP VP : buying DT NN .
here &apos;s a ger@@ man car manufac@@ tur@@ er that VBZ NP NP .
NP VP , ADVP VP .
now these decisions v@@ ary in NP PP that NP VP .
NP , NP PRN VBD NP .
NNS , NP : NP .
so now what PRP VBP VP is NP VP .
so half of the custom@@ ers are going to go from NP , NP , to NP , NP .
the other half of the custom@@ ers are going to go from NP , NP , to NP , NP .
what am i going VP ?
WRB VP you are .
if NP VP , NP VP , that means S .
what you find is the people who go IN NP IN NP , they &apos;re hit@@ ting that de@@ fau@@ lt butt@@ on over and over and over again .
we &apos;re VBG NP .
they go IN NP IN NP , they &apos;re VBG PP .
PRP VBZ NP . PRP VBZ NP .
the only thing WDT NP VP is NP VP .
if NP VP , i learn WHADVP S .
even though choo@@ sing NP VP , it still prepar@@ es me for WRB VP .
NP ADVP VP , so NP VP .
so let PRP NP .
NP VP -- NP VP .
NP VP -- S , NP VP .
because NP VP .
and the more we &apos;re able to be choo@@ sy about choo@@ sing the better NP VP .
VBP NP ADVP .
hi . NP VP , NP VP , and NP ADVP VP .
it &apos;s JJ .
so we &apos;re going to talk a little bit today about WRB NP VP .
NP ADVP VP and SBAR , NP VP .
but now web video has made it so that NP VP .
NP PP MD VP .
but there are over 4@@ 8 hours of video u@@ plo@@ aded to NP NP .
and of DT , only a tiny percentage ever VBZ NP and VBZ NP and VBZ NP .
RB WRB VBZ NP VP ?
CD NNS : NP , NP .
all right , let NP VP .
UH , PRP$ NN . UH , PRP$ NN .
UH , PRP$ NN !
woo@@ o !
RB , NN !
last year , bear vas@@ que@@ z po@@ sted this video that he had shot IN NP IN NP .
IN NP , PRP VBD VP .
this is NP PP .
but he didn NP VP .
he just wanted to VB NP .
because NP VP .
and he had po@@ sted NP PP IN NP .
and this video had actually been po@@ sted NP RB PP .
RB WP VP ?
NN NN RB .
j@@ im@@ my k@@ im@@ mel po@@ sted this t@@ we@@ et that would eventually pro@@ pel the video to be as popular as NP VP .
because NNS IN NP introdu@@ ce PRP IN NP and bring PRP IN NP .
it &apos;s fri@@ day , fri@@ day . got ta get RP IN NP . everybody &apos;s looking forward to NP , NP . fri@@ day , fri@@ day . ge@@ t@@ tin &apos; down on fri@@ day . so you didn &apos; t think that we could RB VB NP PP .
re@@ bec@@ ca black &apos;s &quot; NP VP .
it &apos;s been seen NP NP .
this is NP PP .
and NP , S VBZ S .
so what happened IN NP ?
INTJ NP VP , DT VBZ ADJP .
and if you &apos;re wondering IN NP , those are also fri@@ days .
but what about NP ?
well tosh .0 picked it up , a lot of NP VP .
NP PP VBD NP .
but what &apos;s important is that NP CC NP VBD NP and they shared that with a larger audience , acceler@@ ating the process .
and so then this community formed of people who shared NP VP .
and now there are NP PP .
even in the first seven days , there was one par@@ o@@ dy for NP PP .
unlike DT NML NN IN NP , this community participa@@ tion is WRB NP VP .
so &quot; n@@ y@@ an c@@ at &quot; is NP PP .
it &apos;s DT , ADVP IN NP .
it &apos;s been vie@@ wed NP NP .
and if you think IN S , you should know that NP VP .
even cat@@ s were VBG NP .
cat@@ s were watching NP VP .
but what &apos;s important here is the creativity that it inspired am@@ on@@ gst NP , NP .
RB VBD NP .
NN VBD NP .
and then it went JJ .
an entire re@@ mix community spr@@ ou@@ ted up NP VP .
because NP VP , we participa@@ te .
and who could have predi@@ cted NP PP ?
who could have predi@@ cted NP NP ? &quot;
what scri@@ p@@ ts could you have written NP VP ?
IN NP , NP SBAR MD VP .
WRB NP VP , i ad@@ mit NP NP .
ADVP NP VP , but ADVP NP VP .
by VP , cas@@ ey ni@@ est@@ at got NP VP .
and so this approach hol@@ ds for NN JJ that NP VP .
and so it all brings PRP IN NP ...
WP VBZ NP VP ?
o@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h .
WP VBZ NP VP ?
NP , NP , NP , NP CC NP VBZ NP .
i mean , as VP , NP VP .
no one has IN NP .
and we all now feel NP PP .
and these are not NNS IN NP , and they &apos;re bar@@ ely true IN NP , but they will define DT NN IN NP .
VBP NP .
how can i speak in 10 minutes about the bon@@ ds of women over three generations , about how the ast@@ on@@ ishing strength of those bon@@ ds took hold in the life of a four - year - old girl hu@@ dd@@ led with her young sister , her mother and her grandmother for five days and ni@@ ghts in a small boat in the china sea more than 30 years ago , bon@@ ds that took NN IN NP and never let VP -- that NP VP ?
DT VBZ RB NP .
it is NP VP .
let NP VP .
VB NP : NP VP VBZ NP .
he is NP , NP , NP WHNP S &apos;s unity and freedom .
imagine him as NP VP .
NP , PP , RB VBD NP .
he re@@ treated IN NP .
he died broken IN NP .
PRP VBZ NP .
i never knew PRP IN NP .
but our lives are RB JJR IN NP .
my grandmother never let NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP , but PRP VBD .
the next piece of the j@@ ig@@ saw is of a boat in NP VP .
NP , NP , VBD NP .
for her , life had dist@@ ill@@ ed itself into NP : NP and NP PP .
it was in@@ conc@@ ei@@ vable IN NP that NP VP .
so after NP SBAR , a boat sli@@ pped out to NP VP .
PDT DT NNS VBD NP .
the greatest fear was IN NP .
like NP PP , my mother car@@ ried NP PP .
IN S , RB NP CC NP , RB NP CC NP MD VP .
my first memor@@ ies are from NP : NP into NP , NP .
i don NP VP .
but NP VP , NP VP , VBN PP .
no apple has RB VBN NP .
after NP PP , we land@@ ed IN NP .
and NP PP VBZ NP .
we sett@@ led in NP , NP .
unlike NP VP , there was NP PP .
DT NNS IN NP were IN NP .
and the s@@ ni@@ p@@ pe@@ ts of hal@@ ting english were ex@@ changed between people who had NP PP , they were starting again .
my mother worked on NNS , then IN NP , VBG NP .
somehow she found time to VP CC VP NP .
we were JJ .
NP VP and NP VP .
two pa@@ irs of NNS IN NP , DT VP .
a school uni@@ form down to the an@@ kl@@ es , because it had to last IN NP .
and there were rare but NP PP and NP : NP , go RB . &quot;
go RB PP ?
something sti@@ ff@@ en@@ ed IN NP .
there was NP PP and NP VP . &quot;
NP , NP CC NP VBD PP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
my mother suff@@ ered IN NP RB IN NP .
and my job was to stay a@@ wake until NP VP .
she opened NP ADVP VP .
and the women came IN NP IN NP .
NNS CC NNS VBD VP .
NNS VBD VP .
i lived IN NP .
in CD , i was NP , NP .
in the other , i was en@@ mes@@ hed in NP SBAR , tra@@ gi@@ cally sc@@ ar@@ red by NP , NP CC NP .
but RB NP PP VBD VP .
and for that work , when PRP VBD NP , i was cho@@ sen IN NP .
and NP VP , and NP VP .
tan le , anony@@ mous foot@@ sc@@ ray resi@@ dent , was now tan le , re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e and social activ@@ ist , invited to speak in ven@@ u@@ es NP VP .
i didn NP VP .
i didn NP VP .
i didn NP VP .
i didn NP VP .
NP VP -- NP VP .
i told my mother NP VP .
she remin@@ ded me that NP VP .
no had RB VBN NP .
&quot; just do it , &quot; NP VP , &quot; and don &apos; t be WP NP VP . &quot;
so i spoke out on NP CC NP .
and the more can@@ di@@ dly i spoke , the more NP VP .
i met people from all wal@@ ks of life , so many of them doing the thing NP VP .
and even though NP VP , i realized S .
there had to be NP PP .
and i realized at the same time that it is okay to be NP , NP , new on the scene -- and not just okay , but something to be th@@ ank@@ ful IN NP .
because being DT NN can so easily mean VP , can so easily mean accep@@ ting NP PP .
i have ste@@ pped IN NP RB RB S .
NP SBAR VBD ADVP VP .
RB VBD NP RB , NP , NP .
RB PRP VBD NP .
i gather@@ ed around me a small team of people for whom the lab@@ el &quot; NP VP .
IN NP PRP VBD ADJP .
at NP PP , i made NP PP WHNP S .
we worked RB IN NP .
NP PP VBD ADJP , but NP VP , and NP VP .
i made the decision to move IN NP .
after RB CD NN .
PRP$ NNS RB .
ADVP NP VP , and NP VP .
before NP ADVP ADVP , let NP VP .
NP VP and NP VP .
NN NN &apos; t changed IN NP .
her father died soon after NP VP .
her mother raised NP ADJP .
IN NP PRP VBD NP .
with NP PP , she caused NP , CC NP .
&quot; NP VP .
i was taking a sho@@ wer in NP PP NP-TMP NP VP .
i looked through the sho@@ wer screen and saw her standing IN NP .
i knew NP VP .
PRP$ NN VBD NP ADVP .
DT JJ days later , we went IN NP and sat IN NP .
we told her stories and assu@@ red her that NP VP .
at mid@@ night the mon@@ k came and told us NP VP .
my mother asked us to VB NP .
she asked NP , NP why is it that NP VP and NP VP ? &quot;
&quot; because NP VP .
&quot; you have not let NP VP . &quot;
if NP VP , it runs IN NP .
given WP NP VP and WRB NP VP , we can now see that NP VP .
NN MD VP .
ADVP NP VP , and NP VP .
who could ever wish PRP IN NP ?
yet i am afraid IN NP .
can i give PRP NP , NP , NP ?
i don NP VP .
but if NP VP , i would .
and also , NN NNS NN is RB NN IN NP .
i &apos;m here to VB NP .
or is PRP NN ?
because , of course , this is a photograph that you can &apos; NP VP .
yet , my interest in NN started as NP VP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
and when you take DT NN IN NP , the process ends when PRP VBP NP .
so to me it felt like photograph@@ y was more about being at NP CC NP .
i felt like NP VP .
so i wanted to create something different , something WRB NP VP .
NP PP : NP VP .
but PRP VBZ NP .
and IN NP , PRP VBZ NP .
or photos like NP : NP .
WRB NP VP , i mean NN HYPH NN .
because , of NN , it &apos;s not NP SBAR , but i always want NP VP .
photos WRB NP VP .
so it &apos;s more about VP .
but what &apos;s the trick that makes NP VP ?
is it something about NP CC NP ?
is it NN IN NP ?
what VBZ NP ?
RB DT NN VBZ NP .
but in the end , it comes down to WRB NP VP and WRB NP VP .
it &apos;s not really SBAR , NP VP .
so i think NP VP .
i just see it as NP PP WRB NP VP .
and let NP VP .
here we have NP , NP .
but combin@@ ed IN NP , they can VB NP .
but at the same time , we know NP VP .
so we trick our brains , because our brain simply doesn NP VP .
and i see the same process with VBG NP .
it &apos;s just really about VBG NP .
so the things that VBP S , i think NP VP even think about , DT NNS RB IN NP IN NP .
but when VBG NP , this is really important TO VP , because ADVP NP ADVP VP .
so i would like to say that NP VP .
as NP VP , these images aren JJ NN ADJP .
but combin@@ ed , they can create NN IN NP .
so the first rule is that NP VP .
secon@@ dly , photos combin@@ ed should have NP PP .
and these two images both ful@@ fill these two requi@@ re@@ ments -- shot IN NP and IN NP .
the third one is about making it impossible to dist@@ ingu@@ ish WRB NP VP .
make NP ADJP .
so by mat@@ ching color , contr@@ ast and bri@@ ght@@ ness in NP PP , ad@@ ding photogra@@ phic de@@ fe@@ cts like dep@@ th of NP , NP CC NP , we er@@ ase the bor@@ ders between the different images and make it look like NP , IN NP that NP VP .
RB RB VBZ DT NN .
NP VP and NP VP .
but this image is actually entirely com@@ posed IN NP .
i personally think that NP VP .
but it does require NP PP .
and getting DT NN IN NP , i knew that NP VP , TO VP .
so for NN , the fish was cap@@ tured IN NP .
the shor@@ es are IN NP .
the under@@ water part was cap@@ tured IN NP .
and yeah , i even turned the house on top of DT NN NN to make NP VP .
so to VB NP , i think NP VP .
it always starts with NP , NP .
then it &apos;s about VBG NP .
and RB DT NN VBZ ADJP .
and if NP VP , the result can VB ADJP .
ADVP NP VP , and NP VP .
VBP NP .
i would like to talk to you about WRB NP VP .
and i really think that NP VP .
and one of NP SBAR is NP VP .
RB IN NP -- NP VP ?
how could PRP VB NP ? &quot;
and we think , NP VP , that NP VP .
DT VBZ NP . PRP VBZ NP .
it &apos;s VP .
and every morning i ho@@ p IN NP .
and yes , i &apos;ve got a challenge , as NP VP .
and i put PRP$ NN IN NP .
but the thing is that NP VP .
and NP VP , but ADVP VP .
but RB VBZ NP .
as NP VP , i &apos;ve S .
so every morning i ho@@ p IN NP and before NP VP , people start VP , IN S . &quot;
but NP VP -- SBAR , NP VP .
but on the other hand , it also could be used to get people from out of their cha@@ irs and try to work together in DT NN IN NP to VB NP .
as IN NP , it will RB VB ADJP .
there will be NP VP .
and people will be able , from their homes , to take PRP$ NN NN , send PRP IN NP and eventually share PRP IN NP , IN NP , IN NP .
and this is NP SBAR .
make NP SBAR and start IN NP IN NP .
and you can do this IN NP , CC RB IN NP .
and one of NP VP .
we &apos;ve NP VP .
we maybe even &#91; have &#93; PRP IN NP .
we know perfectly where all the at@@ ms are IN NP .
the other thing is NP VP .
and S , NP VP .
but where would be the ne@@ ar@@ est a@@ ed to VB NP ?
NP VP and NP VP .
nobody knew where NP NP VBD S .
so WP NP VP , we crow@@ d@@ sour@@ ced DT NNS .
NP VP if NP VP sometimes it &apos;s JJ , IN NP .
and NP PP RB VBP VP .
the next step NP VP was TO VP .
and PRP VBD NP .
we made NP , VP , VP .
and whenever you are IN NP collap@@ ses , PRP MD VP , and IN NP RB VBP NP , to VB NP .
and as IN NP , we would VB S .
and we would like to start DT IN NP .
and &#91; we &apos;re &#93; asking all of our colleagues in the rest of NP , NP , to help NP VP .
NP VP , PRP MD VP .
the other thing we would like to ask is of companies also all over the world that will be able to help NP VP .
NP VP , ADVP VP .
so please help PRP IN NP and try VP , but take NN IN NP .
VBP NP .
today i &apos;m going to talk IN NP .
now i work IN NP .
and my small star@@ tu@@ p is looking VP ...
... VBG NP to crowd - sourcing .
it &apos;s NP PP .
hu@@ h . hang IN NP .
it might VB NP S .
NP VP -- NP VP -- NP VP ...
no .
DT VBZ RB ...
okay .
JJ NN VBZ ...
oh , that &apos;s PDT PRP$ NN ?
okay . VBP NP ADVP .
NP VP ; NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
NP VP and NP VP .
instead of VP , we send PRP IN NP .
and there they make great app@@ s , NP VP .
but really what they &apos;re doing is they &apos;re showing what &apos;s possible IN NP today .
RB VB NP .
al is NP PP .
here it kind of looks like NP VP , but WP NP VP .
now how did he come to be looking IN NP ?
we had DT NN IN NP last year through NP PP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
and they noticed that NP ADVP VP .
but one fellow in NP , NP , noticed NN RB , and IN S .
ADVP NP VP , PRP VBD NP .
it &apos;s a c@@ ute little ap@@ p WRB NP VP .
so you agree to dig it out WRB NP .
SBAR , NP VP , and NP VP .
and if NP VP , someone can VB NP PP .
so it &apos;s VP .
DT VBZ NP .
it &apos;s NP PP .
but it &apos;s doing something WDT NP VP .
it &apos;s VP .
there &apos;s a guy in the i@@ .@@ t@@ . department of NP PP who saw this ap@@ p and realized that NP VP , but to get citizens to adop@@ t NN NNS .
NP VP , but NP VP .
so he &apos;s getting citizens to check IN NP .
and then se@@ attle decided to use NP VP .
and chicago just roll@@ ed it out to get people to sign RP IN NP when it s@@ no@@ ws .
so we now know IN NP .
and DT VBZ VP , ADVP , ADVP .
if NP VP , you know IN NP .
pro@@ cur@@ ing software usually takes NP PP .
we had a team that worked on DT NN IN NP last year that took three people about two and a half months .
it was a way that parents could figure out which were NP PP .
we were told after@@ ward that SBAR , NP VP and NP VP .
and DT VBZ NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
and there are NP PP .
so an ap@@ p that takes DT NN IN NP TO VP and then spre@@ ads vir@@ ally , that &apos;s sort of a shot across NP PP .
it suggests how government could work better -- not more like a private company , as many people think NP VP .
and not even like NP , CC NP itself .
and NP VP , NP VP , S .
and that &apos;s JJ .
but what &apos;s more important about DT NN is that it represents WRB NP VP -- not IN NP , but IN NP .
and that &apos;s great news , because , S , NP VP .
now there &apos;s a very large community of people that are building the tools WDT NP VP .
it &apos;s not just code for america fel@@ lo@@ ws , there are hundreds of people all over the country that are standing and writing NP NP IN NP .
they haven &apos; t given RP IN NP .
NP VP , but NP VP , they &apos;re VP .
and these folks know something that we &apos;ve NP PP .
and that &apos;s that when you stri@@ p away all your feelings about NP CC NP at NP CC NP , government is , at its core , in the words of NP PP reilly , &quot; what we do together that we can &apos; NN do alone . &quot;
RB NP PP VBP VP .
and if you &apos;re NP PP , i would ask that NP VP , because NP VP .
NP VP ; NP VP .
and IN NP ADVP VP NP -- VP NP ? &quot; -- WRB NP VP is going VP .
now i didn NP VP .
and like a lot of people , i thought government was basically about getting NP VP .
well after two years , i &apos;ve come IN NP IN S .
this is NP PP .
it &apos;s generally where you will get if NP VP .
IN S , PP NP VP -- PP , NP ADVP VP -- NP VP , VBG S .
RB JJ VBZ DT NN .
he types JJ NN NN IN NP .
he doesn NP ADVP VP . he starts IN NP .
and finally , he says , NP , MD NP VP ? &quot;
RB IN S . so boo@@ ya IN NP .
but NP NP .
boston doesn NP ADVP VP .
it has NP , VP .
now we didn NP VP .
this is NP PP .
so one day -- NP VP -- this came IN : NP IN NP . can VB S .
how do i get NP VP ? &quot;
but what happens with NP VP is different .
so scot@@ t was VBG NP .
but on citizens connect NP VP , so everybody can see this .
and IN NP , DT NN VBD NP .
and the next report NP VP said , IN S .
o@@ pos@@ sum ? check . VBG ? ye@@ p .
turned NN IN NP . walked RB .
NN JJ NN . &quot;
pretty simple .
so this is JJ . this is NP VP .
and it &apos;s also a great example of NP VP .
but it &apos;s RB NP PP IN NP .
and i don NP VP .
i &apos;m just talking IN NP VP .
ADVP NP VP , but NP VP .
PRP VBD NP .
and it could have connected them with government services if NP VP , but NP VP .
when CD NN VBZ NP , we streng@@ then our communities .
NP VP , PRP RB VBZ NP .
now one of NP SBAR is that NP VP .
CC NP VP , but NP VP .
that NP VP .
now how many times have PRP VBD NP -- and ADVP NP VP -- and ADVP NP VP and NP VP ?
that &apos;s because government is like NP CC NP is the six - inch layer on top .
and WDT NP VP .
and we say IN NP .
but it &apos;s that NP VP .
people seem to think NP VP .
if NP VP , we &apos;re VBG S .
because that &apos;s WRB NP VP .
we have to engage IN NP .
so that NP VP .
have PRP VBN NP ?
it &apos;s a group of concerned citizens that have written a very deta@@ iled 325 - page report that &apos;s NP VP .
that &apos;s VP , IN S .
now IN NP , it &apos;s NP SBAR .
you have to see the enormous challenges WDT NP VP .
do we really think we &apos;re going to get where we need to go without fix@@ ing the one institution that can act IN NP ?
NP VP , but NP VP .
the good news is that NP VP .
and RB VBZ NP PP NP NP .
ADVP NP VP , so NP VP .
this is NP SBAR .
they &apos;re not fighting that NP : NP ADVP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
so when they &apos;re fac@@ ed with NP PP , they don &apos; t care as much about using their voices .
they &apos;re VBG NP .
they &apos;re using their hands to write appli@@ cations that make NP VP .
and those appli@@ cations let NP VP .
that could be VP , VP , VP .
and ADVP , NP VP , and NP VP .
but NP VP , and NP VP .
NP VP , PRP VBP NP .
and we &apos;re not going to fix government until NP VP .
so the question NP VP ?
VBP NP .
because NP ADVP VP , and NP VP , i would tell PRP WHNP S .
so i &apos;m going to start out by VBG NP .
and then , so if NP VP .
this is just a random slide that i picked IN IN NP .
WP NP VP you is not RB RB NP , CC NP .
this happens to be a slide of some analysis that we were doing IN NP .
and the interesting thing about it is that this slide , like so NP NP WHNP S , is NP PP .
in JJ NNS , every step here represents NP PP IN NP .
and this is a new thing that we talk IN NP IN NP .
NP ADJP VBZ VP .
and that &apos;s basically what i &apos;m going VP .
so , if NP VP .
if NP VP here .
now why do we draw NN NNS IN NP ?
well the answer is , if i dre@@ w it on a normal cur@@ ve where , S , NP VP , NP VP , and NP VP , the graph@@ s look sort of sil@@ ly .
they sort of go IN NP .
and they don NP VP .
RB if NP , PP , VP , NP VP , it would VB PP .
but when NN IN NP happens , things are qu@@ al@@ it@@ a@@ tively changing .
so if transpor@@ tation technology was moving along as fast as micro@@ process@@ or technology , then the day after tomorrow , i would be able to get IN NP and be IN NP IN NP .
it &apos;s not moving IN NP .
and there &apos;s nothing pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ented in the history of technology development of NP PP where you go by orders of magni@@ tude every few years .
now the question that PRP VBD SBAR is , if NP VP , they don NP VP .
things just can &apos; t possibly keep changing as fast as NP VP .
NP PP VBZ VP .
either NP VP , or ADVP NP VP .
that &apos;s RB DT NP VP .
ADVP NP VP , so NP ADVP VP .
if so , that means that what we &apos;re IN NP is a transition .
we &apos;re sort of on this line in a transition from NP VP .
and so WP NP VP , WDT NP VP , is WHNP S ?
what &apos;s that new state that NP VP ?
because NP VP .
ADVP SBAR , NP VP , and NP VP .
now here &apos;s a conference in which people talk about DT NN , and you notice that the future is still at NP NP .
it &apos;s about as far as NP VP .
so in other words , the future has kind of been s@@ hr@@ in@@ king one year per NN IN NP .
now i think that NP VP .
that transition is happening . we can DT NN NP .
and we know that it just doesn NP VP .
so what PRP MD VP is WP NP VP , WP that NP VP .
now in order to do that i &apos;m going to have to talk IN NP .
because NP VP is VP .
so the time scale WDT NP VP is DT NN NN IN NP .
so i think this picture makes sense if you look IN NP NP IN NP .
RB if NP VP , the earth was NP PP .
and if NP VP , we begin VP .
and i think that there &apos;s theor@@ ies that are beginning to understand about how NP VP , but NP VP .
and NP PP VBD NP .
and those that were IN NP started to spli@@ t and divi@@ de .
and those were the most primi@@ tive forms of cells in NP , NP .
but now those dro@@ ps of oil weren &apos; t really alive , as we say it now , because NP VP .
and every time NP VP , they got sort of JJ NN IN NP .
and so every drop was NP JJ .
IN NP , NP SBAR , VP CC VP CC VP .
so those ten@@ ded VP , VP .
now that NNS ADVP NP , but WRB NP VP was WHADVP S .
somehow by ways that we don NP ADVP VP , these little dro@@ ps learned to write down information .
they learned to record NP SBAR IN NP .
so in other words , they worked out , in this min@@ d@@ less sort of NP , NP .
the amazing thing is that NP VP .
IN NP NP , NP , VBZ ADVP NP .
in fact , every living cre@@ ature is written in exactly the same set of NP CC NP .
in fact , one of NP SBAR is NP VP .
and i &apos;ve got here a little 100 micro@@ gra@@ ms of white po@@ w@@ der , which NP VP RB TO VB NP VP .
but NP VP -- SBAR VP -- NP VP -- and NP VP .
SBAR , NP VP , and NP VP .
if NP VP , i MD VP and VBD NP PP .
RB WP VBD NP ?
VP VBD NP .
and that caused these cells -- that kept them happy IN NP .
but then there was another really interesting step where things became RB JJ , which is NP VP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
now that &apos;s why , IN NP , JJ NN VBZ VP .
some bacteria figured out how to stay away from pen@@ ic@@ il@@ lin , and it went around sort of creating its little dna information with other bacteria , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resi@@ stant IN NP , because NP VP .
now what NP VP VBD NP , in some sense , were in DT JJ NN together ; they were sy@@ ner@@ gi@@ stic .
ADVP NP VP or NP VP .
now the transition point happened WRB NP VP .
and so the next stage that &apos;s interesting IN NP took about another billion years .
and at DT NN , we have NP VP .
and IN NP , PRP VBP NP .
we have lots of cells that are not out IN NP anymore .
your skin cell is really us@@ eless IN NP .
so these communities began to evol@@ ve so that NP VP .
now DT JJ NN WHNP S is IN NP .
DT NNS IN NP , again , began TO NP .
and they began building very special structures that did NP PP IN NP .
and DT VBP NP .
so neurons are the NN NN appar@@ at@@ us that NP VP .
and in fact , they began to get speci@@ alists in NP CC NP .
and that was NP CC NP .
and DT VBD NP NP .
because at that point , an individual -- learning could happen IN NP , RB IN IN NP .
so an organis@@ m could , for instance , learn not to eat DT JJ NN IN NP because NP VP and it got sick last time it ate it .
that could happen within the lifetime of a single organis@@ m , whereas before they &apos;d built these special information process@@ ing structures , that would have had to be learned evolution@@ arily over NP PP by NP VP .
RB that NP , NP .
it could happen IN NP .
but then what happened was DT NNS S , of NP , NP .
and IN NP , NP SBAR VBZ NP .
it &apos;s really a pretty amazing invention if you think IN NP .
here i have NP PP .
i &apos;m VP .
but we &apos;re taking NP ADJP , turning PRP IN NP , and producing NP ADJP IN NP .
so this allows us now to begin to start func@@ tion@@ ing IN NP .
and so , in fact , what we &apos;ve VP VBZ NP , NP , have started abstra@@ cting out .
we &apos;re going IN NP -- abstra@@ cting RP NP PP , pres@@ enting , process@@ ing NN .
so IN NP , DT NN IN NP was NP PP .
NP HYPH PP VBP NP .
and it DT conne@@ cts PRP RB IN NP and able VP .
so now , evolution can take NN IN NP .
and you saw ty &apos;s little evolutionary example where he sort of did NP PP IN NP IN NP .
so now we &apos;ve VP .
so DT JJ NNS IN NP took NP NP .
and DT JJ NNS , IN NP , VBD NP-TMP .
then the next steps , IN NP and RB RB , took JJR IN DT CD years .
and these next steps , like electr@@ on@@ ics , seem to be VBG NP .
the process is fe@@ eding IN NP and becoming , i guess , JJ is NP PP -- when NN VBZ NP .
the more NP VP , the faster it changes .
and i think that NP VP .
we &apos;re seeing NP VP .
ADVP NP , and NP VP .
so right now , what PRP VBP is i NP PP that NP VP .
i don NP VP .
there are NP PP .
instead , what PRP VBP and what NP PP VBP is NP VP and ADVP NP VP and NP VP .
and in fact , sometimes it takes it by metho@@ ds that we don NP ADVP VP .
one method that &apos;s particularly interesting that NP VP is evolution itself .
so what we do is we put IN NP a process of NN that VBZ NP .
so for example , in the most extreme cases , we can actually evol@@ ve a program by starting out with NP PP .
INTJ , NP , MD NP VP .
now would you please run NP PP , run NP PP , and pick RP NP SBAR . &quot;
so IN NP , i define WHNP S .
let NP VP .
so find the programs that come NP PP .
so of course , random sequences of in@@ struc@@ tions are very un@@ likely to VB NP , so NN IN NP will RB VB NP .
but CD IN NP , IN NP , may VB NP .
and i say , S , MD NP VP .
save DT . VB PRT NP .
and now let &apos;s re@@ produce the ones that sor@@ ted NP NP .
and let NP VP . &quot;
VB NP and NP VP , and NP VP .
so i &apos;ve got now a new generation of programs that are produced IN NP .
UH , NN UH VB NP . &quot;
VBP NP ADVP .
VB NP ADVP .
and VB NP ADVP and VBP NP PP .
UH NP PP VBZ NP .
so i can do NP PP IN NP , IN NP .
at DT NN IN NP , i end up with NP SBAR .
in fact , they are programs that are much more efficient than programs NP VP .
now if i look IN NP , i can &apos; NN VB NP SBAR .
i &apos;ve tried looking at PRP and telling you WRB NP VP .
PRP VBP NP .
but PRP VBP NP .
and in fact , i know , i &apos;m very confi@@ dent that they do the job because NP VP .
in fact , their life depen@@ ded on VBG NP .
NP VP , and NP VP , NP S . VB PP .
it says , &apos; NP VP . &apos; doesn &apos; t that make NP VP ? &quot;
in fact , we know that NP VP .
so we &apos;re beginning to dep@@ end IN NP VP .
and it lets NP VP .
and yet , we don NP ADVP VP .
so IN NP , it &apos;s VP .
we &apos;re now using those programs to make much faster computers so that NP VP .
so it &apos;s fe@@ eding RB IN NP .
NP VP and NP VP .
RB NP PP VBP VP .
we &apos;re VP .
and what we are is we &apos;re IN NP .
so we &apos;re the amo@@ e@@ b@@ as and we can &apos; NP VP .
we &apos;re right at NP PP .
but i think that there really is NP VP .
i think NP VP .
and i think DT IN NP here are NP PP .
ADVP NP VP , and NP VP .
my story begins right here actually in JJ IN NP ago .
i was IN NP , IN NP .
and we were in conversation about how nothing had changed IN NP IN NP . &quot;
so back in the day , when NP VP and NP VP .
now we do DT JJ IN NP .
back then , WRB NP , SBAR , NP VP , he &apos;d S .
now we do DT JJ IN NP .
the conclu@@ sion that NP VP was that NP VP .
and this made NP ADJP .
i found myself becoming NP PP .
i was terri@@ fied by DT NN that NP VP .
and it felt like NP VP .
WHADVP S , PRP$ NN VBD NP NP .
and NP PP VBD NP PP .
it became a gil@@ ded g@@ ate@@ way into a world full of NP CC NP in my imagination .
ADVP NP VP and NP VP .
they stopped us from VP .
and so i jum@@ ped in , NP VP .
i &apos;ve been illu@@ str@@ ating books since NP VP .
and so WRB NP VP , i saw PRP IN NP .
it can know WRB NP VP .
it can know WRB NP VP .
it brings RB NP CC NP .
NN VBZ VP .
but what are we doing IN NP ?
so i &apos;m actually just going VP and NP , NP IN NP .
so it says , NP NP . &quot;
and so -- it says , VP NP .
and actually i become NP PP .
IN NP , NP VP -- and NP VP .
the child in me is really excited by NP PP .
now i &apos;ve been talking DT NN IN NP .
and i don &apos; t mean NP , NP VP .
this idea of NP PP , for DT NN , was always really exciting IN NP .
and so over here you need to VP , VP .
and they actually ill@@ umin@@ ate your way through NP PP .
another idea that really fascin@@ ated me as a child was that an entire galaxy could be contain@@ ed IN NP .
and so over here , each book and each world becomes a little mar@@ ble that i dra@@ g in IN NP .
and PRP VBZ PRT NP .
ADVP , NP VP , but NP VP .
this is a map that gro@@ ws and glo@@ ws and becomes your navi@@ gation for NP PP .
it reve@@ als PRP IN NP IN NP RB RB .
so i &apos;m just going VP .
NP SBAR VBZ VP .
RB RB , DT VBP NP .
so we &apos;ve NP VP and we &apos;ve NP VP , but WRB JJ people outside IN NP know IN NP ?
these poor ap@@ sar@@ as have been tra@@ pped IN NP IN NP .
and so we &apos;re bringing them back in NP PP .
and a story that actually de@@ als IN NP .
S , NP VP VBZ SBAR NP .
but now with mobile technology , we can actually take our children outside into NP PP .
one of NP PP is that NP VP .
WRB NP VP , i had NP PP .
and somehow kids don NP VP .
so IN S , you need VP .
in another chap@@ ter , you need to take a picture of NP CC ADVP NP .
and what happens is that you actually create NP PP .
NP PP VP CC VP , S . &quot;
a child in NN says , &quot; NP VP . &quot;
and it creates NP PP IN NP .
in the possibilities of lin@@ king RB NP , NP CC NP , there are multiple possibilities .
in the next book , we plan IN S and IN NP , you see DT NN IN NP appear IN NP .
IN NP , PRP$ NN VBZ VP .
and so you need to make NP PP and VB NP ADVP and VB NP .
NP VP , NP VP , and NP VP .
we &apos;re har@@ n@@ ess@@ ing NN IN NP .
we &apos;re bringing our children and ourselves closer to the natural world and that magic and joy and childhood love that we had through NP PP .
VBP NP .
well this is NP PP .
i spend NP PP IN NP , IN NP , IN NP .
i spend NP PP IN NP .
and being here IN NP and seeing the stimu@@ lation , VBG NP , has been very , very energi@@ zing IN NP .
and one of NP SBAR is that NP VP .
and you can actually say things here that have NP PP .
and sometimes when it comes through ted , it has meaning and power that it doesn NP VP .
and i mention that because NP VP .
and we &apos;ve VBD NP .
and i think what we &apos;ve learned is that , if you &apos;re a teacher NP VP , but if NP VP , they can be especially meaning@@ ful .
if NP VP you can VB NP , but if NP VP you can VB NP .
and so i want to talk IN NP .
and i didn NP VP .
i actually learned IN NP IN NP .
i grew up in a house WDT VP , and that NP VP .
NP VP , NP VP , NP VP .
she was NP PP .
she was NP PP .
she was NP PP .
her parents were born IN NP IN NP .
she was born in NP CC NP very much sha@@ ped NP SBAR .
CC NP VP , but NP VP .
SBAR , NP VP and NP VP .
and she &apos;d squ@@ ee@@ ze me so ti@@ ght i could bar@@ ely brea@@ the and then she &apos;d let NP VP .
and an hour or two ADVP , SBAR , NP VP and NP VP , do you still feel NP VP ? &quot;
and if NP VP .
and she just had this quality that you always wanted to be IN NP .
and the only challenge was that NP VP .
my mom was NP PP .
and sometimes when i would go and spend NN IN NP , it would be difficult TO VP .
my cou@@ s@@ ins would VB VP .
and NP VP , and NP VP .
and my grandmother was sitting across NP VP .
and at first i thought NP VP .
S CC S , but NP VP .
and IN NP , PRP VBD PRT and NP VP and NP VP and NP VP , &quot; come RB , NN . you and i are going VP . &quot;
and i remember this just like NP VP .
i never will VB NP .
NP VP and NP VP , NP VP , but NP VP . &quot;
PRP VBD NP . &quot;
NP VP , RB ADVP NP VP . &quot; NP VP . &quot;
ADVP NP VP and NP VP and NP VP . &quot;
and she said , &quot; NP VP . &quot;
she said , &quot; NP VP . &quot;
i will RB VB NP .
and then she said , &quot; i just need you to VB NP NP , NP . &quot;
PRP VBD NP . &quot;
she said , &quot; the first thing NP VP . &quot;
NP VP , and NP VP . &quot;
INTJ NP VP , so NP VP , NP INTJ , NN . i &apos;ll S . &quot;
then she said , &quot; the second thing NP VP . &quot;
CC NP VP and NP VP , NP INTJ , NN . i &apos;ll S . &quot;
then finally she said , &quot; the third thing NP VP . &quot;
INTJ NP VP , so NP VP , NP INTJ , NN . i &apos;ll S . &quot;
NP VP , and NP VP .
WRB NP VP , NP-TMP NP VP and NP VP -- PRP VBP SBAR -- and NP VP and NP VP .
and NP VP we cra@@ zi@@ ly did .
and NP VP and NP VP and NP VP , and PRP VBD NP PP .
NP VP , no , no . that &apos;s JJ . you all go RB . i &apos;m not VBG S . &quot;
NP VP , ADVP VP . NP VP ; NP ADVP VP .
NP VP , PRP$ NN VBD NP . VB NP . &quot;
NP VP , PP , NP VP . NP NP VBP ADVP . NP NP VBP ADVP . &quot;
and then my brother started star@@ ing IN NP .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s wrong IN NP ? have some be@@ er . &quot;
ADVP NP VP and NP VP . &quot;
NP VP , ADVP ADVP , WHNP SQ ? &quot;
he said , &quot; oh , mama tells all the grand@@ kids WDT NP VP . &quot;
PRP VBD VP .
and i &apos;m going to ad@@ mit NN IN NP .
i &apos;m going to VB NP NP .
i know NP VP .
but NP VP , and NP VP .
NP VP ; NP VP .
when we create NP PP , we can say things to NP PP that NP VP .
we can get NP VP .
WRB NP VP she would VB NP .
my grand@@ father was IN NP IN NP .
my male un@@ cles died IN NP .
and these were the things NP VP .
well i &apos;ve been trying to say NN IN NP .
this country is very different today than NP VP .
IN NP , EX VBD NP .
NN , EX VBP NP .
the united states now has the highest rate of NN IN NP .
we have NP PP .
and JJ NN , IN NP , has RB VBN NP .
IN NP , PP NP VP , NP VP , NP VP .
CD IN IN CD black men between NP PP is IN NP , IN NP , IN NP .
in urban communities across DT NN -- NP , NP -- 50 to 60 percent of all young men of NN are in ja@@ il or prison or on prob@@ ation or par@@ o@@ le .
our system isn &apos; t just being sha@@ ped IN NP , they &apos;re also di@@ stor@@ ted by NN .
we have a system of justice in this country that tre@@ ats you much better if NP VP .
NN , RB NN , VBZ NP .
and yet , we seem VP .
the politics of fear and an@@ ger have made us believe that NP VP .
PRP VBP VP .
it &apos;s interesting IN NP .
we &apos;re looking IN NP .
my state of NN , like NP PP , actually perman@@ ently dis@@ en@@ fran@@ ch@@ is@@ es you if NP VP .
RB RB IN NP CD NN IN NP has RB VBN NP S .
we &apos;re actually proje@@ cting in another 10 years NP VP .
and EX VBZ NP .
PRP VBP NP .
DT NN IN NP are RB JJ .
the united states is the only country in the world where we sentence 13 - year - old children to die IN NP .
we have life im@@ pris@@ on@@ ment without NN IN NP .
and we &apos;re RB VBG NP .
DT JJ NN IN NP .
i represent NNS IN NP .
it &apos;s interesting , DT NN IN NP .
in many ways , we &apos;ve been taught to think that NP VP ?
and DT VBZ NP .
but there &apos;s another way of thinking about where we are IN NP .
the other way of VP , do NP VP ?
NP VP , PRP VBZ ADJP .
death pen@@ al@@ ty in NN is defined IN NP .
for every nine people who have been ex@@ ecu@@ ted , we &apos;ve actually identi@@ fied one inno@@ cent person who &apos;s been ex@@ on@@ er@@ ated and rele@@ ased IN NP .
NP PP -- NP ADJP .
NP VP , PRP VBZ ADJP .
in a@@ vi@@ ation , we would never let NP VP .
but somehow we can insu@@ late PRP IN NP .
PRP VBZ RB NP .
PRP VBZ RB NP .
PRP VBZ RB NP .
i talk DT NN IN NP .
i talk about race and this question of whether NP VP .
and it &apos;s interesting , WRB NP VP .
i tell PRP IN NP , NP SBAR .
we don &apos; t really know very much IN NP .
but for NP PP , that was NP VP .
IN NP , NNS VBD S .
they had VP .
it was NP PP .
CC NP VP now and S , S , S , S NN IN NP . &quot;
they tell NP VP . &quot;
and that era of NN , of NN , was followed IN NP .
and yet , we have IN NP NP SBAR .
we don &apos; t like to talk IN NP .
and because IN NP , PRP RB NP NP VBD SBAR we &apos;ve done RB .
we &apos;re constantly running IN NP .
we &apos;re RB VBG NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
in south africa , people understood that we couldn &apos; t over@@ come NN IN NP IN NP .
IN NP , PP , NP VP , but PP NP VP .
i was giving NP PP IN NP .
it was fascinating because NP VP , &quot; well you know NP VP . &quot;
he said , &quot; NP VP .
and of course , we can never have NP PP . &quot;
and NP VP , and NP VP , PP , NP VP .
it would be un@@ consci@@ on@@ able IN NP to , in NP , VP . &quot;
and i thought IN NP .
what would it feel like VP ?
i couldn NP VP .
PRP MD VP .
and RB , IN NP , IN NP , PRP VBP NP .
and yet , there is NP VP .
well i believe that NP VP .
that SBAR , NP VP .
PRP VBP NP .
PRP VBP NP . PRP VBP NP .
PRP VBP NP .
but ADVP , NP VP , NN , NN , NN .
and for me , it becomes necessary to VB NP .
because ultimately we are talking IN NP VP .
and for me that means spending time thinking and talking IN NP , NP , NP .
but thinking IN NP IN NP .
you know ultimately , we all have to believe NNS NP NP .
we do . as rational as we are , as commit@@ ted to NN as NP VP .
NN , NP , NP comes not IN NP RB .
they come IN NP .
and it &apos;s that NP VP .
NP , NP , VBD PP .
he said , &quot; when we were in JJ NN and dealing IN NP , we wanted DT NNS IN NP , but mostly what we needed was NP , NP and be a wit@@ ness . &quot;
well that ori@@ entation of the spirit is very much at the core of what i believe even ted NP VP .
there is no S attention IN NP , IN NP , IN NP , IN NP , IN NP .
now i will war@@ n you that NP VP .
it will get IN NP .
i had NP PP .
and NP VP , and NP VP .
and these women would VP CC ADVP VP .
and ADVP NP VP , and NP VP , S . PRP VBP VP .
do you want VP ? &quot;
and i &apos;d say , &quot; INTJ , NP , NP VP . &quot;
and she &apos;d say , &quot; well what are you going to do WRB NP VP ? &quot;
i said , &quot; NP VP . &quot;
CC NP VP and NP VP , i would RB VB .
it would be so VP CC ADVP VP .
and one time i was over there listening to S , CC S and NP VP .
tell me WP NP VP . &quot;
and i began VBG NP NP .
NP VP , RB ADVP NP VP .
we &apos;re trying to help NP SBAR .
we &apos;re trying to con@@ front bi@@ as and dis@@ crimin@@ ation in NP PP .
we &apos;re trying to end NN IN NP .
we &apos;re trying to do NN IN NP .
we &apos;re trying to VB NP .
we &apos;re trying to VB NP . &quot;
i gave her my whole ra@@ p , and when i finished NP VP and NP VP , &quot; mm@@ m mm@@ m mm@@ m . &quot;
she said , &quot; NP VP . &quot;
and that &apos;s when m@@ s. car@@ r le@@ an@@ ed ADVP , NP VP , NP VP , NP VP . &quot;
and i actually believe that NP VP .
we need to find ways to embra@@ ce NP , NP , NP .
because ultimately , our humanity depen@@ ds IN NP &apos;s humanity .
i &apos;ve learned very simple things doing the work WDT NP VP .
it &apos;s RB VBN NP NP .
that NP VP we &apos;ve RB VBN .
i believe that IN NP .
i think if NP VP , they &apos;re not just a li@@ ar .
i think if NP VP , they &apos;re not just a th@@ ie@@ f .
i think even if NP VP , you &apos;re not just a kil@@ ler .
and because of that there &apos;s this basic human dig@@ ni@@ ty that must be respe@@ cted IN NP .
i also believe that IN NP , and RB IN NP , that NP VP .
i don NP VP .
NP ADVP VP , PP , NP VP .
and ADVP , NP VP , NP VP , S .
ultimately , you ju@@ dge the character of a society , not by how they treat NP CC NP CC NP , but by how they treat NP , NP , NP .
because NP VP .
i sometimes get IN IN NP . i &apos;ll NN IN NP .
i sometimes push RB JJ .
i do get ti@@ red , as NP ADVP VP .
sometimes those ideas get ahead IN NP in NP SBAR .
and i &apos;ve been repres@@ enting NP SBAR .
and NP VP and NP VP , and PRP VBZ VP .
NP VP , well , how did DT VB ?
how can a ju@@ dge turn you into NP SBAR ?
CC NP VP , but NP VP .
and NP VP and NP VP , well go@@ sh , IN S , DT NN MD VP .
UH , JJ , DT NN VBZ NP .
you should ask IN NP .
and because NP VP , i started VP .
and i had NP SBAR .
and NP VP , and NP VP . &quot;
and i put in my motion that there was NP CC NP CC NP .
there was DT JJ NN IN NP about how there &apos;s NP PP , it &apos;s all mis@@ condu@@ ct .
and NP-TMP , NP VP and NP VP NP SBAR ?
and PP , ADVP VP NP , but NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
and i finally decided , INTJ , NP VP .
and NP VP and NP VP .
and NP VP and NP VP .
and i was thinking , NP VP .
and NP ADVP VP and NP VP .
and as NP VP , there was NP SBAR .
when NP VP , NP VP and NP VP who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; NP VP . &quot; he said , IN S ? &quot; NP VP yes , sir . &quot;
and NP VP and NP VP .
and he wh@@ is@@ per@@ ed IN NP .
he said , &quot; NP VP . &quot;
and i have to tell NP , NP VP .
it connected RB IN NP IN NP , IN NP , IN NP .
well i went IN NP .
and as soon as NP VP , the ju@@ dge saw PRP VP .
NP VP , VBD NP VP ? &quot;
NP VP , FRAG , NP . PRP VBD . NN CC PRP VBD S .
and people started coming in because NP VP .
i had VBN NP .
and police off@@ ic@@ ers were VP CC NP .
and before i knew it , the cour@@ tro@@ om was filled with people an@@ gry that NP VP .
and out IN NP , i could VB NP ADVP .
and NP VP , and NP VP .
PRP VBD NP ADVP .
and finally , this older black man with DT ADJP NN IN NP came into DT NN and sat down IN NP , almost IN NP .
about 10 minutes later the ju@@ dge said we would VB NP .
and during the break there was a de@@ pu@@ ty s@@ her@@ i@@ ff who was offen@@ ded that NP VP .
and NP VP and NP VP .
NP VP , &quot; j@@ im@@ my , what are PRP VBG PP ? &quot;
and this older black man stood up and he looked IN NP and he looked IN NP and he said , IN S . &quot;
i &apos;ve come to ted because NP VP , but it ben@@ ds toward justice .
that we can not be full evolved human beings until we care about NP CC NP .
that NP VP .
that NP VP .
and more than anything , for those of you who share that , i &apos;ve simply come to tell NP VP , hold on .
so you heard and saw an obvious desire by NP , NP , VP CC VP .
NP PP , WP MD NP VP ?
well there are NP PP .
if NP VP , there &apos;s DT NN VP .
IN NP , RB IN NP PRP VBP VP .
and yet , CD NN IN NP don NP PP .
NP PP VBP NP .
so there &apos;s an opportunity to VB NP .
and this refer@@ end@@ um would pro@@ pose having NP VP .
and i think that NP VP .
there &apos;s been NP PP IN NP .
and part of NP PP is sometimes that NP VP .
what would you say IN NP ?
UH RB DT JJ NN NN VBZ VP .
NP PP RB IN NP .
it was NP PP .
that &apos;s where the dra@@ matic incre@@ ases have come IN NP .
and we got car@@ ried away with NP PP .
and so we have three stri@@ kes laws that put people in prison forever for ste@@ aling DT NN , IN NP , rather than making NP VP .
i believe NP VP .
and i think NP VP .
and i think that &apos;s the ori@@ entation WDT NP VP .
br@@ y@@ an , you &apos;ve VP .
PRP VBP NP .
thank you so much for coming IN NP . thank you .
thre@@ ats , in DT NN IN NP , have spi@@ ked .
NN IN NP . NN NN spra@@ y .
vi@@ cious car@@ tel@@ s . NN CD : JJ NN NNS .
socie@@ tal deca@@ y . CD JJ .
tsun@@ ami war@@ ning . cyber@@ -@@ attac@@ ks .
drug war . mass destruction . tor@@ na@@ do .
rec@@ ession . de@@ fau@@ lt . do@@ om@@ s@@ day . eg@@ y@@ pt . sy@@ ri@@ a .
crisis . death . disaster .
UH , PRP$ NN .
so DT VBP NP i colle@@ cted IN NP -- could have RB VBN NP .
the point is that NP ADVP VP .
and there &apos;s NP PP .
every second of NP , NP bring in NN ADJP NNS than NP VP .
and because nothing is more important to PRP than NP , NP VBZ NP called the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala .
RB DT NN VBZ NP , NP .
it sorts and sc@@ ours through all of NP VP .
so given DT NN news stories , we will pre@@ fer@@ enti@@ ally look IN NP .
and that old newspaper saying , &quot; if NP VP , &quot; is very true .
so given NP PP NP-TMP , NP NP , it &apos;s no wonder that NP VP .
it &apos;s no wonder that NP VP .
but RB DT VBZ RB NP .
perhaps instead , of what &apos;s ADVP VP .
perhaps the tremendous progress we &apos;ve made IN NP IN NP are , in fact , acceler@@ ating to a point that we have DT NN IN NP VP .
now i &apos;m not saying NP VP -- we sur@@ ely do .
and PP , NP VP , but ADVP NP VP .
so let NP VP .
over the last hundred years , the average human li@@ fes@@ pan has more than dou@@ bled , average per capit@@ a income ad@@ ju@@ sted IN NP IN NP has tri@@ pl@@ ed .
childhood mortality has come down DT NN IN NP .
add to that NP VP .
steve pin@@ ker has showed us that , in fact , we &apos;re living IN NP RB IN NP .
and charles ken@@ ny that NP VP .
we truly are living IN NP .
and JJ NNS VB NP .
and we keep VBG NP S .
in fact , we re@@ define WP NP VP .
NN IN NP , in NN today , DT NN IN NP still have NP , NP , NP , NP , NP , NP , NP CC NP .
NP , NP , MD VP .
under@@ p@@ inning much IN NP is technology , and of late , exponenti@@ ally growing technologies .
my good friend ray kurz@@ weil showed that NP VP .
that &apos;s WRB NP VP .
now look IN NP .
this is NP PP .
i want NP VP .
number one , how smo@@ oth it is -- IN NP , NP CC NP time .
this is the result of NP VP .
it doesn &apos; t slow IN NP .
and also , even though NP VP , it &apos;s VP .
the rate IN WHNP NP VP is itself getting RBR .
and IN NP , VP , VBP NP available to NP PP .
NP , NP NP NP ; NP : NP ; NN NN , WHNP S .
i mean , how many of PRP saw NP PP IN NP ?
NP VP , DT VBD ADJP .
in fact , i sc@@ ou@@ red the head@@ lines looking for the best head@@ line in a newspaper NP VP .
and i love DT : NP VP . &quot;
NN NNS RB DT JJ NN .
it &apos;s IN NP .
and imagine if NP VP .
NP IN NP , NP CC NP VBD NP .
and we teach our students all of these technologies , and particularly how they can be used to VB NP NP .
and every year we ask NP VP .
think about NP , NP that , ADVP , NP VP .
NP PP MD VP .
today we can point IN NP .
SBAR , NP VP ; NP VP .
it is about taking NP SBAR and making NP ADJP .
NP VP , NP VP , and NP VP .
let NP VP .
so this is NP PP .
he &apos;s NP PP .
he invited over IN NP DT NN IN NP .
all of na@@ po@@ le@@ on &apos;s tro@@ ops were f@@ ed with NP , NP with NN NNS .
but the king of NN , he was f@@ ed IN NP .
NP VP , NN VBD NP .
it &apos;s the reason that NP VP .
you see , even though NP VP , NP VP .
it &apos;s NP VP .
but then the technology of electro@@ ly@@ sis came along and literally made al@@ umin@@ um so cheap that we use PRP IN NP .
so let NP VP .
we think IN NP .
ladies and gentle@@ men , we are IN NP .
16 ter@@ a@@ wat@@ ts of NN hits NP VP .
NP VP , PRP VBZ PP .
and RB VBZ NP ADVP .
for the first time , this year the cost of solar - generated electricity is 50 percent that of NP PP -- NP CC NP .
NP PP VBD NP NP-TMP .
last month , mit put out a study showing that IN NP , IN NP , solar electricity will VB NP a kil@@ o@@ watt hour compared to NP PP .
and if NP VP , we also have JJ NN .
now we talk IN NP .
do you remember WRB NP VP after NP ADVP VP ?
PRP VBD NP . WP VBD NP VP ?
VB NP . &quot;
because NP VP .
we live on NP VP .
UH , NP VP , NP VP , and NP VP .
and there is NP VP .
RB NP , NP .
and the conversation NP VP it is DT NN IN NP .
it &apos;s able to generate a thousand li@@ ters of NP NP out IN NP -- at QP NNS a li@@ ter .
the cha@@ ir@@ man of coca - cola has just agre@@ ed to do NP PP .
and if that p@@ ans out , which i have NP SBAR , coca - cola will de@@ plo@@ y this glob@@ ally to NP PP .
this is NP , VP .
and we &apos;ve seen NP PP .
my goo@@ dness , we &apos;re going to hit NP PP IN NP .
think about it , that NP PP VBZ NP re@@ ag@@ an did 25 years ago .
and if they &apos;re PP , NP VP clin@@ ton did 15 years ago .
they &apos;re living in NP PP WDT NP VP .
JJR IN NP , NP SBAR -- NP , NP CC ADVP NP , NP , NP -- are RB RB VBG CC VBG PP .
probably the best part of it is what &apos;s coming down DT NN IN NP .
last month , i had the pleasure of announ@@ cing with NP VP .
we &apos;re JJ NNS IN NP TO ADVP VP , because NP VP , NP VP , you can do NP VP .
and to win , it needs to be able to diagno@@ se you better IN NP .
so literally , imagine this device in NP PP WRB NP VP .
when NP NP WHNP S recognize , it calls the c@@ d@@ c and pre@@ v@@ ents the pan@@ de@@ mic from VP .
but here , here is NP PP .
i call NP NP .
so the white lines here are NN .
we just passed DT NML NN IN NP .
and IN NP , NP PP VBZ VP .
in 2010 , we had just short IN NP ADVP , connected .
by 20@@ 20 , that &apos;s going IN NP .
NP SBAR VBP VP .
WP MD NP VP ?
WP MD NP VP ? WP MD NP VP ?
and rather than VP , we &apos;re RB VP .
these people represent tens of trilli@@ ons of NP VP .
and NP VP , and NP VP .
so what could NP PP VB PP ?
how about NP PP .
what about giving NP , NP CC NP ?
WP MD NP VP ?
what about contribu@@ tions we can &apos; NP VP ?
the one thing NP VP is that NP VP .
let NP VP .
there is a program that NP VP .
it &apos;s NP VP .
it came IN IN NP IN NP .
and this is a game where individuals can actually take DT NN IN NP and figure out WRB NP VP .
and WRB NP VP dic@@ tat@@ es NP CC NP .
and it &apos;s very important IN NP .
and up IN ADVP , it &apos;s VBN NP .
and this game has been played IN NP and RB RB .
and it &apos;s ADVP , NP VP .
and it showed that , in fact , today , the human pattern recogni@@ tion machin@@ ery is better at NN NN IN NP .
and when NP VP , NP VP , NP VP , NP VP the world &apos;s JJS NN fol@@ der .
ladies and gentle@@ men , what gives me JJ NN IN NP is the fact that we are now more em@@ powered IN NP VP .
we have NP PP .
we have NP PP .
we have NP PP .
and we have NP VP .
we are living IN NP RB .
VBP NP .
i think NP VP .
and i think NP VP , and NP VP .
and maybe i &apos;ve been around long enough that NP VP .
before NP ADVP VP , let NP VP .
NP , RRC ?
we &apos;re IN NP , we &apos;re VBG NP .
NP ADVP VP , VP NP ?
baseball is filled IN NP .
and there &apos;s NNS IN NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
i &apos;m going to focus on one st@@ at that i hope NP VP .
it &apos;s VBN NP .
so we talk about NP , NP who bat@@ s 300 .
that means that NP , VP .
NP VP , NP VP , S , CC S and NP VP .
CD NNS out IN NP .
do you know what they call NP PP ?
JJ , RB JJ , NP NML .
do you know WP NP VP ?
that &apos;s somebody who hit , IN NP , NP RB PP .
le@@ gen@@ dar@@ y -- as IN NP le@@ gen@@ dar@@ y -- the last major lea@@ gue baseball player to hit QP IN NP .
now let NP VP .
suppose NP VP and NP VP .
RB NP VP , VBZ NP ?
NP VP and NP VP and NP VP .
but , CC , PRP VBP SBAR ?
she &apos;s VP . she &apos;s IN NP .
and she &apos;s VBG NP .
RB NP VP .
but i &apos;m going to VB NP NP .
what do you think a bat@@ ting average for NP VP ?
CD , RB JJ .
now truth of the matter is , nobody knows in DT IN NP what NP CC NP VBZ VP .
WP NP VP is NP VP .
RB ADVP , ADVP VP , but NP VP .
and that was the message that i absor@@ bed when i was IN NP .
PRP VBD NP .
in high school , a class@@ mate once said that NP VP .
and RB PRP VBD .
and i studied IN NP IN NP .
and PRP VBD NP .
i memor@@ i@@ zed in my an@@ atom@@ y class the orig@@ ins and exer@@ tions of NP , NP .
i even knew the differ@@ enti@@ al diagno@@ sis in how to VB NP .
and all the while , i was VBG NP .
and i did well , i gradu@@ ated with NP , NP .
and i came out IN NP with DT NN that if NP VP .
and it worked for DT NN , until NP VP .
i was a resi@@ dent at a teaching hospital here in tor@@ onto when mr@@ s. dru@@ cker was brought to NP PP WRB NP VP .
at the time i was as@@ sig@@ ned IN NP IN NP .
and it was my job , when NP VP VB , to see DT NN IN NP .
and to report RB IN NP .
and NP VP , and NP VP .
and WRB NP VP , she was VBG NP .
and when i listen@@ ed IN NP IN NP , i could hear cra@@ ck@@ ly sounds on NP SBAR .
NP VP , and PP , NP VP , NP VP , and NP VP .
and that wasn &apos; t NP VP .
NP VP and NP VP .
PRP VBD NP NP . PRP VBD NP S .
i gave her medi@@ cations that NP VP .
and over NP CC NP , she started VP .
and i felt RB JJ .
CC NP VP ; NP VP .
RB , PRP VBD NP .
i sent her home without speaking IN NP .
NP VP , SBAR ADVP NP VP .
and he knew NP , NP VP .
maybe i did PRP IN NP .
maybe i didn NP VP .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so able to take responsibility that NP VP and NP VP patients without even having to contact him .
the second mistake WDT NP VP was worse .
in VBG NP , i dis@@ re@@ gar@@ ded NP VP . don JJ NN do this . &quot;
in fact , so l@@ ac@@ king IN NP was i that NP ADVP VP , &quot; do you think NP VP ? &quot;
and NP VP - S VP . &quot;
i can remember that like NP VP .
ADVP NP VP , and NP VP , par@@ am@@ edi@@ cs came VP .
and i went RB PP IN NP .
PDT DT NN IN NP , that after@@ noon , i had NP PP .
but i car@@ ried RP IN NP .
and at DT NN IN NP , i pac@@ ked RP VP and walked IN NP VP .
i walked through NP PP home .
and it was there that NP , NP , VBD NP PP that VBP NP .
NNS IN NP NP VP , but NP VP .
the three words are : VB NP VP ?
&quot; do you remember that NP VP ? &quot;
DT JJ NN VBD NP .
&quot; well she &apos;s NP PP .
well she was RB RB right .
she was RB and IN NP .
IN NP SBAR , NP VP and NP VP and DT NNS VBD NP ADVP PP SBAR .
and NP VP and NP VP .
and DT NN . NN VBD PRT NP .
they gave her medi@@ cations to VB NP .
they put PRP$ IN NP .
and i was sho@@ cked and sha@@ ken IN NP .
and i went through this roll@@ er co@@ aster , because after NP VP , she went IN NP , and i hop@@ ed IN NP IN S .
and over the next two or three days , it was clear that she was never going VP .
PRP VBD NP .
and DT NN VBD .
and IN NP , PRP VBD NP PP .
and IN NP , PRP VP : NP .
they say you never forget NP PP .
and that was my first time to be ac@@ qua@@ in@@ ted IN NP .
IN NP , NP VP and NP VP .
you know that healthy kind , when you betra@@ y a secret that a best friend made NP VP , but IN NP NP SBAR , i &apos;ll never make that mistake again .
and NP VP and NP ADVP VP .
that &apos;s NP PP .
NP SBAR VBZ NP .
it &apos;s the one WDT VP , not that SBAR VP , but that NP VP .
and it was WP NP VP .
and it wasn &apos; t because IN NP ; PRP VBD NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
and i kept VBG NP NP .
why didn &apos; t NP VP ? why did i send her home ?
and ADVP IN NP ?
why did i go IN NP ?
RB CC RB , PRP VBD .
i began VP .
and PP , NP VP and NP VP and NP VP .
and i made myself a bar@@ gain that if only NP VP , UH VB NP stop .
and PRP VBD .
and i went RB IN NP .
and then it happened RB .
ADVP NP VP , and NP VP .
it was bus@@ y , i was in DT NN IN NP .
he kept VP .
i looked IN NP , it was DT JJ NN p@@ ink .
and i VBD NP NP and VBD NP PP .
and even as he was walking out the door , he was still sort of poin@@ ting IN NP .
and two days later i came to do my next emergen@@ cy shift , and that &apos;s when my ch@@ ie@@ f asked to speak IN NP quie@@ tly in her office .
and she said DT CD NNS : VBP NP VP .
&quot; do you remember that NP VP ? &quot;
well it turns RP , he didn NP VP .
he had NP VP .
PRP MD VP , but NP VP , and NP VP .
and RB PRP VB NP .
NP VP and NP VP .
and i went through NP PP and felt cle@@ ans@@ ed and went back IN NP , until NP VP .
ADVP IN NP , PRP VBD NP .
now that takes NP VP .
ADVP IN NP , NP VP and NP VP .
one NP VP had a kid@@ ney stone .
i or@@ dered a kid@@ ney x-@@ ray . when it turned RP VP , my collea@@ gue who VBD VP noticed some ten@@ der@@ ness in NP NP and called the surge@@ ons .
the other one had NP PP .
i or@@ dered some flu@@ ids to VB NP and asked my collea@@ gue to VB NP .
and he did and when he noticed some ten@@ der@@ ness in NP NP , called the surge@@ ons .
IN NP , NP VP and NP VP .
but each time , they were g@@ na@@ wing IN NP , VP .
and i &apos;d like to be able to say to you that my worst mistakes only happened in NP PP as NP VP , which is total b@@ .@@ s .
NP PP VBP VP .
RB , JJ CC JJ .
here &apos;s the problem : if i can &apos; NP VP , if i can &apos; t find NP SBAR , how can i share it with my colleagues ?
how can i teach them about what i did so that NP VP ?
if NP VP .
when was the last time NP VP ?
oh yeah , you go to a cock@@ tail party and you might hear about some other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear NP VP .
SBAR , NP ADVP VP , NP VP , NP VP and NP VP .
and in fact , if NP VP and NP VP , i &apos;d VP .
that &apos;s the system WDT NP VP .
it &apos;s NP PP .
it &apos;s NP : NP , NP , NP CC NP .
and it &apos;s almost like DT JJ NN , like NP VP .
and we have NP SBAR .
but there are NP PP .
IN NP or RB IN NP , i &apos;ve VBN NP S . &quot;
and what PRP VBP VP is that NP VP .
we work in a system where er@@ r@@ ors happen NP VP .
in DT NN , IN JJ IN NP die IN NP .
IN NP , NP PP VBD NP PP .
in both cases , these are gro@@ ss S as NP VP .
and RB VBZ DT NN .
in DT NN NN WHADVP S , we can &apos; NP VP .
NN NN VBZ ADJP .
we can &apos; NP VP .
we have our cognitive bi@@ ases , so that NP VP .
now take DT JJ NN IN NP , make NP ADJP and put NP PP IN NP , and suddenly my history is l@@ ac@@ ed IN NP .
i don NP VP .
NP VP ; NP VP .
and NP PP : NP VP .
given DT IN NP , mistakes are inevi@@ table .
so if you take NP , CC NP out all the error - prone health profession@@ als , well there won &apos; t be NP VP .
and you know that NP VP ?
IN NP , IN NP PRP VBD NP NP ? NN CC PRP MD VP .
and NP VP , S , then NP VP .
they want to VB NP . they want to VB NP .
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don NP VP . &quot;
what they need is an environment to be able to VB NP .
WHNP S VBZ NP .
and it starts IN NP .
the re@@ defined physi@@ cian is human , knows NP VP , but stri@@ ves TO VP .
she shares PRP$ NN IN NP .
she &apos;s suppor@@ tive when other people talk IN NP .
and she points out other people &apos;s mistakes , not IN NP , but IN NP so that NP VP .
and NP VP , and SBAR , NP VP .
so the system is evol@@ ving to create bac@@ ku@@ ps that make it easier to dete@@ ct NP , NP , CC NP , when we do make NNS , we &apos;re re@@ war@@ ded for coming clean .
PRP$ NN VBZ NP .
PRP VBP NP .
PRP VBP ADJP . PRP VBP NP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
i still don NP VP , but i can live IN NP .
and let me close IN NP : i do remember .
i &apos;m going to speak IN NP .
and this is about VBG NP .
and because NP VP , i will VB NP NP SBAR .
and the first story is IN NP , NP PP .
and he was here , as NP ADVP VP .
and you &apos;d think NP VP , but NP VP .
he was RB VBG NP .
and he described NP PP SBAR . &quot;
DT VBD NP .
a big fis@@ her@@ y was run IN NP IN NP .
now the fish is IN NP .
now this story , we have heard it lots of times on NP CC NP , so there is nothing particular about it .
but the point is , we still come IN NP .
we still think NP VP .
the bro@@ ch@@ ures still say NP VP .
RB WP VP ?
the second story , also to VB NP , is called VP .
because NP VP .
NP VP and NP VP .
and i thought NP VP .
and NP VP , and NP VP .
DT VBD NP .
and the la@@ go@@ on was surro@@ unded by NP CC NP .
and it had NP NP , NP PP .
and NP VP and NP VP and NP VP .
when i went RB NP RB , the fish had s@@ hr@@ un@@ k to NP PP .
they were ma@@ turing IN NP .
PRP VBD VP .
RB VBD ADVP NP .
they were RB RB PP .
and the fish also were happy VP .
ADVP NP VP , but NP VP .
my third little story is that NP VP .
IN NP -- NN VBD NP .
NP VP and NP VP .
and NP VP , and NP VP .
and WP NP VP , we didn S .
SBAR , NP VP , VBZ NP PP .
and CD NN IN NP were NP , NP .
and actually most of the fish , they are a little spot on NP , NP , were coral re@@ e@@ f fish .
RB NP PP VP CC ADVP VP .
and these pictures are extraordinary because NP VP .
IN NP , NP VP and ADVP NP VP .
the bottom is trans@@ formed IN , IN NP IN NP .
DT VBZ NP .
they were not e@@ aten , they were thro@@ wn away because NP VP .
and CD NN PRP VBD NP .
PRP VBD RB VP .
and then they wanted to kill it because NP VP .
NP PP VBZ ADVP VP they go IN NP .
but PRP VBZ ADJP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
if NP VP , NN IN NP happens .
you have IN NP NP : NP .
and PP NP VP -- NP VP , or RB .
every generation will use the images WDT NP VP .
and DT NN RB , they percei@@ ve IN NP .
but they don NP VP .
you can have NP PP .
at the end you want to VB NP .
and that , to DT JJ NN , is WP NP VP .
we want to susta@@ in things that are gone or things that are not the way NP VP .
now one should think NP VP .
because , obviously , DT NN WHNP S , before NP VP , it becomes JJ .
so you don NP VP .
PRP RB VBP NP .
and therefore they &apos;re not percei@@ ved IN NP .
over time , we concent@@ rate IN NP , and IN NP .
they become r@@ ar@@ er because NP VP .
PP NP VP and NP VP .
and the question is , WRB VBP NP VP ?
well because NP VP &apos; t know that NP VP .
and IN NP , NP PP MD VP .
and they will con@@ test this because NP VP they would like the evidence pres@@ ented .
for example , the an@@ ec@@ do@@ te that NP VP VP CC VP &apos;s not &quot; scientific . &quot;
so you have a situation WRB NP VP , even though NP VP , because PRP VBP NP S .
and RB , NP PP MD VP .
because IN NP , we actually re@@ create DT NN .
we re@@ create the past that NP VP and is extremely low .
that is IN NP .
how about the people who can &apos; t do that because they have no access -- the people in NP PP ?
there i think that NP VP .
this is NP PP .
there were gra@@ y wh@@ ales in ch@@ es@@ a@@ pe@@ a@@ ke bay NP IN -- NP IN .
and you will have noticed that NP VP . &quot;
and if NP VP ?
because NP VP .
and so my re@@ com@@ men@@ dation , NP VP , is for NN TO VP .
VBP NP ADVP .
in NP PP , if NP VP , you had VP .
you had to regi@@ ster DT NN NN IN NP out IN NP .
and this was done so NP VP .
if they found a paper which had NP PP , they could track down who created that thought .
and we in the west couldn &apos; t understand how anybody could VB NP , how much this would VB NP .
we would never do DT IN NP .
but today in 2011 , if you go and buy a color las@@ er prin@@ ter from any major las@@ er prin@@ ter manufac@@ tur@@ er and print a page , that page will end up having s@@ light yellow dots prin@@ ted on every single page in a pattern which makes the page unique IN NP and IN NP .
this is happening IN NP NN .
and nobody seems to be making DT NN IN NP .
and this is an example of the ways that our own governments are using technology against NP , NP .
and this is NP PP .
if NP VP , we can NN NP .
PRP VBP NP .
PRP VBP NP .
like here , we have mr. di@@ mit@@ ry gol@@ u@@ bo@@ v from the city of NN IN NP .
and DT NNS IN NP are RB JJ S .
DT NNS VBP NP .
they use online attac@@ ks to make NP , CC NP .
we actually have NP , NP .
here &apos;s NN NN NN tar@@ tu in est@@ on@@ ia .
this is VBN NP .
DT VBZ NP .
DT VBZ NP .
this is NP , NP CC ADVP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
NP , PP , VP , and NP VP .
NP NP VP ; NP VP .
and i cla@@ im NP VP that NP VP .
and it &apos;s very obvious that NP VP .
IN NP , NP PP MD VP .
the second major group of NP SBAR are not motiv@@ ated IN NP .
they &apos;re motiv@@ ated IN NP -- motiv@@ ated by NNS , motiv@@ ated IN NP , motiv@@ ated IN NP .
NP PP VP CC VP .
IN S , NP VP , but ADVP NP VP .
and then we look IN NP .
this is a prime example of what happens when governments attack IN NP .
NP VP -- or ADVP , NP VP .
it was running into NN last fall because NP VP .
NP VP and NP VP .
and i asked last week in NP PP , NP VP .
and PRP$ NN VBD INTJ .
so how do people die IN NP ?
UH NN VBZ NP .
PRP VBP NP .
what do you do IN NP ?
well you need a cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate if NP VP .
RB PRP NP VP , but NP VP .
except NP VP .
and NP NP .
and this is exactly what happened IN NP .
what about NP SBAR ?
well in NN , the ri@@ ot@@ ers lo@@ ot@@ ed NP PP IN NP , and WRB NP VP they found NP PP .
IN NP , VBD NP . &quot;
and within that bin@@ der were notes from a company based in germany which had sold NP NP of tools for inter@@ cep@@ ting -- and in very large scale -- all the communication of the citizens of the country .
they had sold NP PP IN NP .
DT NN NN VBP ADVP .
so western governments are provi@@ ding tot@@ al@@ it@@ arian governments with tools to do DT IN NP .
but western governments are doing PRP IN NP RB RB .
IN NP , IN NP , NP PP VBD VP .
if NP VP , your phone will VB VP .
but today , it goes IN NP .
they will VB NP .
they will even use tools like state tro@@ j@@ an to infe@@ ct your computer with a tro@@ j@@ an , which en@@ ables NP VP .
now when we think JJR IN NP , the obvious response from people should be that , NP INTJ , NP VP , but that doesn &apos; t really affect me because PRP VBP NP .
WRB MD NP VP ?
because NP VP . &quot;
and this is an argument , which doesn NP VP .
NN VBZ VP .
priv@@ acy is not up IN NP .
this is not a question between NN IN NP .
it &apos;s a question of NN IN NP .
and while NP VP , DT NN S will VB VP .
and do PRP VP , VP , NP ?
and these are the questions that we have to worry about IN NP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
the first con@@ cre@@ te blocks were manu@@ f@@ actu@@ red IN NP IN NP .
very quickly con@@ cre@@ te blocks became NP PP .
they en@@ ab@@ led us to VP , NP , NP , NP .
essentially con@@ cre@@ te blocks had become NP PP .
NP RBR in CD , le@@ go came RP IN NP .
it was VBN NP .
and IN NP , NN NNS VBD NP PP .
it &apos;s esti@@ ma@@ ted that NP VP .
you don NP VP .
le@@ go made NP ADJP .
le@@ go has essentially taken NP and made it into NP PP .
mean@@ while the ex@@ act same year , at bell lab@@ s the next revolution was about to be VBN , NP .
the transi@@ st@@ or VP pil@@ ed on NP PP to DT NN WRB NP VP .
like DT JJ NN , the transi@@ st@@ or allows NP VP .
but RB VBZ NP : NP VP .
NP ADVP VP , so NP VP .
eight years ago when i was IN NP , i started explor@@ ing NP PP .
NP PP VBD NP .
let NP VP .
li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its are NP PP .
they &apos;re pre-@@ engine@@ ered VP , mot@@ ors and sensor@@ s .
and the best part about PRP is NP VP .
so you can &apos; NP VP .
the bri@@ cks are NP HYPH VBN .
NP VP , NP VP , NP VP and NP VP .
ADVP NP VP and ADVP NP VP .
NP VP , PRP MD VP .
NP VP and ADVP NP VP .
VP , and ADVP NP VP .
VP and NP VP .
i &apos;m going to VB NP .
RB RB NP , NP VBP ADVP ADJP .
instead of VP , li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its allow PRP IN NP .
so to VB NP ADVP , you would RB VB NP and RB make NP VP .
the idea behind NNS is that NP VP .
we want to make NP PP IN NP .
NNS , VP , NP , NP MD VP .
we &apos;ve been giving NNS IN NP and seeing NP VP .
and it &apos;s VBN NP .
the ni@@ c@@ est thing is how they start to understand the electr@@ on@@ ics around them from everyday that they don NP VP .
for example , WRB NP VP , or WRB NP VP , or WRB NP VP .
we &apos;ve also been taking li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its to VB NP .
so for example , we &apos;ve had NP ADVP VP .
ADVP NP VP , PRP VBP NP ...
a few weeks ago PRP took NNS VP and gave PRP IN NP and told NP VP . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of NP , NP can@@ on ball .
but wait , NP VP .
it &apos;s NP VP .
IN NP , S , NNS VBD NP .
and we want to make this material acc@@ essi@@ ble IN NP .
RB NNS VBZ NP .
you can go on NP , NP , make them yourself .
we want to encoura@@ ge DT NN IN NP , because NP VP .
RB VP CC VP .
VBP NP .
