it &apos;s that NP .
IN NP NN .
PRP VBD NP ADVP VP .
RB WHNP S VBZ NP .
what do you do when you have NP PP ?
ste@@ phen pal@@ um@@ bi : VBG NP
i really thought NP VP .
but we didn NP VP .
and now we would like to introdu@@ ce PRP IN NP .
NP : and NP ADVP VP .
NN NN , NN , NN , NN NP CC NP .
PP , NP VP ; NP VP .
DT NN S , IN NP IN NP .
ADVP , NP PP -- NP : NP .
i &apos;m going to look quickly at the fourth and fif@@ th categ@@ ories , which are NP , NP CC NP .
it may be that NP ADVP VP .
i believe that NP VP .
DT JJ NN , PRP VBZ NP .
so , think IN NP NP VP RB : NN , NN , NN .
they were living on NP PP WRB NP VP .
so , how many of you have ever gotten behind the whe@@ el of a car when you really shouldn NP VP ?
one of NP SBAR is WP NP VP .
now , clearly we &apos;re not going to put a couple of NNS IN NP and understand exactly what DT IN NP are IN NP .
VB NP , and VB NP .
so today , i &apos;m going to tell you about some people who didn NP VP .
so a few years ago , l@@ .@@ a. coun@@ ty decided that they needed to VB NP S .
i mean , literally , NP VP .
so these three guys all understand how to produ@@ c@@ tively chan@@ nel NNS IN NP VP .
PRP$ NNS , JJ CC JJ , play NP : NP , NP , NP , NP CC NP .
and reading that book made me re@@ exam@@ ine that theory because NP VP .
and i think because FRAG , NP VP .
and my question is , WRB VBD NP VP ?
i went IN NP .
and yet , we have nobody who is trying to en@@ sure that NP VP .
and he ended up achie@@ ving IN NP .
the experience of down syndro@@ me people inclu@@ des those who are NP , NP .
and a lot of the time the question of NN is , what do we v@@ ali@@ date IN NP , and what do we cure IN NP ?
and ultimately i feel that PP ADVP NP VP and NP VP
and he had NP , SBAR .
and i came IN NP . i was RB JJ .
never shown NP IN , and probably going VP .
NP VP , DT VBZ VP .
you want DT JJ NN , IN NP .
if NP VP , they can VB PP ADVP .
not something NP VP .
and NP VP , ADVP , NP VP , and NP VP .
CC NP VP -- NP VP -- but NP VP .
RB RB ADVP IN NP , PRP VBP NP .
and we &apos;re building IN NP .
but remember , NP VP .
and when you think about the economy through these two different len@@ ses , you understand why this crisis is so hard to VB , because ADJP , ADVP NP VP and NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
the phr@@ ase that you want , if NP VP or NP VP , &quot; PRP VBP NP .
we know what it &apos;s like to have NP PP , in con@@ gress , y@@ elling about how the end of the world is coming if NP VP happened about the dollar ever since there &apos;s been a dollar .
and he said IN NP why have you put stuff on NP SBAR ? &quot;
i thought , INTJ NP VP .
the wir@@ ing from your sensor@@ y appar@@ at@@ us to those bits is shor@@ ter than the bits that have to pass through NP , NP .
WRB VBP NP VP ?
and RB NN , NP , NP NP ADVP VP . UH , DT VBZ NP . &quot;
so i &apos;m going to sh@@ am@@ el@@ ess@@ ly ex@@ pose NN IN NP .
and then i can &apos; NP VP .
no one &apos;s going to VB NP .
but what i have to do now , feeling again , what i &apos;ve got to do is to be able to supply enough of these enzy@@ mes , of these tri@@ g@@ gers IN NP ADVP IN IN NP .
no time . NP VP , so NP VP .
now i think NP VP .
NP VP , PRP MD VP .
we need NNS , we don NP VP .
you need VP .
this comes across also in the way IN WHNP NP VP .
and when they teach NP NP , they do it via the body .
but that feeling of NN is struc@@ tural IN NP .
DT NNS IN NP , IN NP , tend VP .
if NP VP , NP VP , you have VP .
and PRP VBP , NP . NP VP , VBP NP NP ADJP ? &quot;
because NP VP .
so it took me from NP PP IN NP , IN NP , IN NP , NP IN NP and RB IN NP .
you need something like tens of NP PP in order to VB NP .
the toi@@ lets there are literally holes in NP VP .
so this is NP VP .
DT NN RB VBZ NP .
an@@ il an@@ anth@@ as@@ w@@ am@@ y : WP NP VP
well , first you have to , as NP , NP the problem . how big is it ?
and a boo@@ k@@ mobile -- the size of a van with NP , NP , NP , CC NP make their own books .
we have CD IN NP now . it &apos;s completely cool .
but PRP VP : VP VP .
the ge@@ tty here is moving their books to the u@@ cl@@ a , which is where we have NP NP , and scan@@ ning their out - of - copyright books , which is fab@@ ul@@ ous .
it costs NP NP VP and put PRP RB , IN S .
we ten@@ ded towards longer - term things and also things that people can re@@ use and make into NP , SBAR .
so anyway , you &apos;ve got basically an idea of WRB NP VP .
so en@@ vision what it looks like NP VP .
it looked more like DT WRB NP VP -- not quite so pretty .
and RB , PRP VBP NP .
but these are RB VBN NP .
so , NP CC NP NML IN NP .
NP VP -- NP VP .
and i &apos;ll show PRP NP RB .
there &apos;s a v@@ et@@ ted press rele@@ ase that you can read -- NP VP -- if NP VP . &quot;
so , the house is RB RBR su@@ it@@ able IN NP .
NP PP MD VP .
so we had NP , NP .
QP IN NP went IN : NP .
NP VP , RB RB IN NP VP .
but on the other hand , it was DT JJ NN IN NP , because NP VP .
i had been VBG NP .
and all of it was coming from NP : NP .
PRP VBZ NP . &quot;
and if NP VP , i would VP , VP .
the cause of our trou@@ bles is actually the complexity WDT NP VP .
we have now found treat@@ ments for NP PP that NP VP .
there NP NP that NP VP , and that &apos;s NP PP .
sk@@ ill number one is the ability to recognize NP CC NP VP .
we got the lead safety engineer for bo@@ eing to VB NP .
there NP NP IN S , forces NP VP .
and most of DT NNS are because PP NP VP .
SBAR , NP VP , and ADVP , NP VP .
but if you &apos;re VP , you can &apos; NP VP . and we &apos;re really worried about VP .
and bees are RB JJ .
and RB RB , NNS VBP RB NP ADVP .
but i also want to rein@@ force some of the ideas NP VP .
well actually , i &apos;ve NP VP .
PRP VBD NP .
and i want VP .
DT IN NP are RB JJ .
and they also are able to show and to exhi@@ bit such a wonderful and complex behavior that can be described just with NP PP .
look IN NP .
how is it possible VP ?
and WRB VBP NP ADJP ?
VBP NP .
they &apos;re going VP .
and also in NP PP , people partici@@ p@@ ated .
and because NP VP , there were NP PP IN NP .
they &apos;re wearing CC NP CC NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
and RB VBG SBAR that help was IN NP IN NP .
our goal over the next year is to get NP ADJP IN NP and to open - NP SBAR .
now why am i talking IN NP ?
so WP NP VP , about PRP$ NNS , about NP , NP , NP , NP , NP .
all NP VP is -- facts . facts only .
except , of course , it wasn &apos; t NP VP .
the lesson NP VP is NP VP .
and how can PRP VB NP ?
i &apos;m NN RB IN NP .
yes .
but i wish NP VP .
and here i think , &quot; VB NP . &quot;
INTJ , NP PP NP NP , NP . &quot;
now do NP ADVP VP , &quot; don &apos; t listen IN NP , that &apos;s just sat@@ an talking ! &quot;
e@@ ars are made RB IN NP , but IN S .
it looks NP PP .
if you can &apos; t hear somebody talking IN NP IN NP , it &apos;s too l@@ oud .
ADVP IN NP , VB ADVP .
and my relationship to NP SBAR , well , i can say NP VP .
ADVP NP VP , and NP VP , i gave PRP DT NN .
and then you can take DT JJ NN NN IN NP .
and so we &apos;re like , &quot; NP VP . &quot;
okay , just wait IN NP . this is JJ .
it &apos;s really going to be NP , NP , CC NP and creating this world in their back@@ y@@ ards and in their kit@@ ch@@ ens .
but they won NP VP .
but einstein always thought NP VP .
it would be bad if NP VP , RB than NP VP .
this is IN NP -- DT ADJP NN NN .
and RB , RB IN NP two black holes have VBN .
galaxies form , and NP PP VBP PP , and IN NP NP , NP , VBZ NP .
RB S , IN NP , VBP NP NP ?
of NP VP , 60 will VB PP .
UH , PRP VBZ NP .
from the fact that NP VP .
i go everywhere to make believe NP VP .
ADVP VP NP -- NP VP .
it can &apos; NP VP .
CD NN VBZ .
i will come IN NP RB .
NP VP , and NP VP , either NP VP or NP VP . period .
you act RB .
if NP VP , then you have DT NN .
and let NP VP .
PRP VBZ NP .
IN NP , NP VP , and ADVP NP VP .
and you can go to the site right now . it &apos;s all free . not trying to VB NP .
red means they &apos;re JJ .
and we &apos;re VP CC ADVP VP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
and they &apos;re literally saying , &quot; S , but ... &quot; IN NP , DT NN IN NP said , &quot; i have DT NN IN S . &quot;
but NP VP , and NP VP .
i see NP PP . they are VBG PRT NP .
NP VP , ADVP NP VP .
the first thing NP VP saw a hand@@ ker@@ ch@@ ie@@ f in NN .
and he turned RB . and then he divi@@ ded IN NP IN NP .
but no more than one percent of the people ac@@ knowledge them , because they are afraid NP VP .
WRB NP VP , the primary visual cortex is VBN .
it is only if NP VP .
and actually i &apos;m NP VP .
but NP VP , and NP VP .
it &apos;s JJ .
this looks IN NP IN NP .
and NP VP i developed NP SBAR .
and it does actually seem to be trying to VB NP .
edi@@ th wid@@ der : DT JJ , JJ NN IN NP
NP VP , but NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
CD NN IN NP goes IN NP , the other side gets NP PP -- NP PP .
it &apos;s able VP , WRB NP VP .
humanity is RB RB IN NP .
during 4@@ 1 years of teaching NN IN NP , i watched sa@@ dly as bright students turned away from NP PP from VP because NP VP .
ju@@ dge opportunity by how few other students and researchers are IN NP .
or larger , what &apos;s NP PP IN NP ?
humans have lived IN NP . no@@ ma@@ di@@ c h@@ unter@@ s bring down rab@@ bits , VBG NP .
more recently , that power is VP CC VP , we &apos;re going VP , walking IN NP , carrying or wearing NP VP .
he used the example of a common gra@@ zing area in which each person by ADVP VP led to NP CC NP .
to@@ y@@ ota , instead of VP , tre@@ ats PRP IN NP and tra@@ ins NP VP .
what forms of suffering could be alle@@ vi@@ ated , what forms of wealth could be created if NP VP ?
now , i &apos;ll VBP NP NP -- we &apos;ve been working IN NP IN NP .
yeah , yeah , RB IN NP , RB IN NP .
bla@@ ise ag@@ Ã¼@@ era y arc@@ as : augmented - NN NNS
this was IN NP .
and IN S , NN VBD VP , and SBAR , NP VP , and NP VP .
WP VP ?
i said , &quot; how many of you now go home earlier than NP VP ? &quot;
ADVP NP VP , PRP RB VBD NP PP .
the next part NP VP is NN IN NP .
you had to VB NP and VB NP , S .
at NP PP , we had NP PP .
IN NP , DT VBP NP .
and PRP VBP ADVP NP .
this is NP PP .
but IN NP PRP VBD NP .
one day a man told me , &quot; NP VP , but NP VP . &quot;
RB DT NN RB VBZ NP .
we re@@ vis@@ ed the mental health compon@@ ent of the primary NN NN services by ad@@ ding NP HYPH NP HYPH NP IN NP .
WRB NP VP , she saw NP : NP . and yet , in NP PP , there were QP NNS . NN NNS IN NP &apos;s NP CC , ADVP , NP .
that &apos;s true IN NP .
top left , we have canada and australia , with NP , NP , CC NP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
but the same goes IN NP RB RB .
next , there &apos;s DT NN NN .
so , if NP VP , VB , today our total energy consumption is NP SBAR .
NP VP , and NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
from the minute a child &apos;s taught how to VB NP , he &apos;s no longer poor .
think IN NP , RB RB ? i &apos;m VBG S .
JJ NNS NN .
that actually occur@@ red DT NN . she took JJ NN .
we are obs@@ essed IN NP .
classi@@ c . hi@@ p fra@@ c@@ ture often leads to NN IN NP .
DT NNS IN NP , and NP SBAR IN NP never done before .
PRP VBZ ADJP . NP VP , NP VP , and NP VP .
we will VB NP .
this is NP PP , the black hole explo@@ it NP , ADJP IN NP .
ADVP NP VP , and ADVP , PP , NP VP .
what &apos;s really insu@@ l@@ ting about NP VP , you have to regi@@ ster DT NN .
NP , CC NP VBZ NP .
okay ? so you can see NP PP .
you see , technology &apos;s changing IN NP , and that NP VP .
i wasn NP ADJP .
you all know NP , NP .
and that was RB JJ .
it was JJ .
&quot; NP VP : NP VP . &quot;
and they obviously make a lot of money off IN NP .
and RB PRP VBD .
and quite frank@@ ly , i think if NP VP , he could RB VB NP .
NP VP , NP VP , NP VP .
that &apos;s what &apos;s in NP PP every single year .
VP , and NP VP .
NP PP , IN NP . not JJ NN .
western countries throw RP NP PP , RB IN S -- but because NP VP look JJ . tri@@ stra@@ m stu@@ art VP , calling for NP PP .
and this is all done , IN NP , IN NP .
now , we &apos;re going to be going to NP NP-TMP . and when we do , it &apos;s going to be un@@ fair IN NP .
&quot; listen , i &apos;m VP . can you call PRP IN NP ? &quot;
we have names for places where people don NP VP .
JJ NN , NN , NN CC NN , CD NNS and NN .
now this is NP PP .
he &apos;s DT JJ . there is little kids le@@ an@@ ing on NP , NP . we got ta VB NP PRT ADVP , ladies and gentle@@ men .
JJ NNS , NN , NP PP .
every top ad@@ ds RP IN NP .
it just seems like NP VP , it &apos;s hidden .
VBP NP .
it was RB JJ .
it thought of itself as VBG VP , but it was possible IN NP to VB NP , and software got in NP SBAR .
and so if NP VP , you should VB NP PP .
good after@@ noon .
ADVP NP VP , VP : CC ADVP VP NP PP .
today we &apos;re moving IN NP .
before that day , this is WRB NP VP .
speaking of NP , NP are basically DT JJ NN S .
of course , sea cu@@ cum@@ bers sho@@ ot them out NP , SBAR .
and he does manage to find them , but NP , NP .
i couldn NP VP .
s@@ her@@ man &apos;s RP IN NP .
and you &apos;re getting NP PP .
IN NP , NP SBAR VBZ NP .
the ta@@ hl@@ tan have called IN NP .
S NP VP , or NP VP . VP VBP NP ? 1,@@ 0@@ 3@@ 4 ?
5@@ 29 .
NP VP -- INTJ , NP VP .
in NP ADVP , let NP VP .
ok , DT CD IN NP .
NN : NNP .
WHNP , NP , MD NP VP ?
NN : CD . six .
ADVP , NP VP , plus NP VP .
a third time , it &apos;s RB VBG NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
had colle@@ cted NNS IN NP , as NP VP .
and i &apos;ll just say what i &apos;m about to do . what i &apos;m about to do -- i hope you can recognize that there &apos;s NP , RB NP IN NP .
but NP VP , and NP VP .
RB , CC NP VP .
i &apos;m VP . a ri@@ ot &apos;s going RP IN NP .
i VBP PRT NP , and RB VBZ NP .
well i &apos;m here to suggest ADVP VP NP .
RB , NP : NP VBZ ADJP .
maybe , just maybe , less might VB NP .
that fix@@ ed behavior -- which is ri@@ gi@@ d and stere@@ ot@@ yp@@ ed and ends up with NP : NP .
if we &apos;ve got S , the right brain of each of them becomes att@@ un@@ ed , so that the jo@@ y@@ ful emergen@@ ce of NP PP and NP PP is something NP VP .
DT VBZ S -- NP VP and NP VP . other situations wouldn NP VP .
PRP VBD VP , and NP VP , and PP NP VP , it was obvious IN S -- VP .
and i think if you think about NN without NP NP and .
found that when he looked IN NP IN IN NP , he felt something different .
characteri@@ zed IN NP IN NP .
and its hu@@ gely important IN NP and cra@@ f@@ ting DT NN .
we decided VP -- so IN NP , S , S , CC S , ju@@ pit@@ er NP VP .
h@@ c : so , after NP PP , we came RP IN NP , and as NP VP it basically forms JJ NN NN .
h@@ c : so this is where NP VP and NP VP .
so , why VB NP we hear more about DT NN ?
WRB VP ? PRP VBD NP . PRP VBD NP .
and NP PP VBZ VP . WDT VP ?
the full videos are online if NP VP .
but if NP VP then you &apos;ll VB NP .
i &apos;d like to show you thing called s@@ n@@ out , which is -- NP PP is to make a robot that appe@@ ars as if NP VP .
if NP VP , why was PRP NP IN S ?
deep in NP PP , two h@@ unter@@ s stal@@ k their pre@@ y .
they &apos;re also going to VB NP NP ?
NP VP , and NP VP . PRP VBD NP .
and let NP VP -- it &apos;s NN S .
and PP , NP VP , and NP VP .
and they &apos;re t@@ we@@ eting , IN NP , IN PP IN NP .
people have raised NP PP IN NP .
my mother says that NP VP .
PRP$ NN VBD NP .
i must say that before NP VP i didn NP ADVP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
WRB NP VP , i began VP .
now , the conven@@ tional wisdom was that NP VP .
she introduced them to DT NN about NP SBAR : &quot; NP VP , and NP VP . &quot;
NP ADVP RB HYPH VBN .
well IN NP , i want VP .
we need to fundament@@ ally re@@ define who it is that NP VP .
NP VP : NP VP .
would PRP VB NP NP ?
al@@ an@@ na sha@@ i@@ k@@ h : WRB NP VP
the network has NP PP .
the battery is not NP , PP .
and these pri@@ ces are RB IN NP .
and i had to qu@@ it and come and do NP VP .
as we star@@ ed sc@@ aling it up we looked at what is the problem VP ?
we go back down . it &apos;s going VP .
now where is NP PP ?
now when we &apos;re looking at VP , we need to start thinking IN NP .
we have to VB NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
now , there &apos;s NP , NP .
and however we define athei@@ s@@ m , it &apos;s sur@@ ely DT NN IN NP that NP VP .
in 199@@ 8 , lar@@ son and with@@ am po@@ ll@@ ed the cre@@ am of NP , NP dro@@ pped to a VP percent .
darwin said , &quot; NP VP .
non@@ eth@@ eless , if we want to attra@@ ct deep down athei@@ sts to come out publi@@ c@@ ly , we &apos;re going to have find something better to stick IN NP IN NP or &quot; tea@@ po@@ t ag@@ no@@ stic . &quot;
PRP VBP NP S .
WHNP S VBZ SBAR and NN VBZ VP . not that NP VP but that NP VP . DT IN NP , IN NP , has NP PP .
the critical innovation here is instead of our engineers , or our people saying which is the most relevant , we &apos;re going to go out and count what NP , NP , IN NP -- NN , NN -- produced NNS , and ti@@ ed IN NP . we &apos;re going to count those , and count them up .
and if NP ADJP , think IN NP .
but -- and this is the dark lin@@ ing -- it is thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed by -- in the same way that NP VP -- the in@@ cum@@ b@@ ent industrial systems .
due to some slip - ups , he managed to es@@ cape d@@ ressed as a woman and ran from london back to nigeria where , according to NP , NP , president -- as IN NP -- have NN and can not VB VP . but what happened : people were so ou@@ tra@@ ged by this behavior that it was possible for his state leg@@ is@@ l@@ ature to im@@ pe@@ ach him and get him out IN NP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
and in the three years that PRP VBD NP , they made DT NN IN NP IN NP .
and what is more important , because NP VP -- and NP VP came not from the oil sector alone , but from non-@@ oil .
not NP VP , but NP VP .
so , she &apos;ll make DT JJ NN IN NP , with NP VP . very creative designs , has reach@@ ed NP SBAR .
every year , CD NNS IN NP die IN NP .
this worked well for most pa@@ tho@@ gens , some@@ what well for cra@@ f@@ ty bu@@ gs like NN , but not at DT IN NP , IN WHNP NP VP .
and also , WP NP VP is NP PP .
NP VP , but NP-TMP , NP VP .
in DT JJR NN , WP NP VP is VB NP S .
lu@@ ck@@ ily for us , we live in NP PP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
FRAG , NP VP , but NP VP .
and these are not really a people op@@ pres@@ sed IN NP .
NP VP , VBZ NP , NP .
did you know that NP VP ?
i bel@@ ong to NP , NP , and i asked NP , NP VP , &quot; since CD , we &apos;ve S . &quot;
DT VBZ RB NP . PRP VBZ NP .
if NP VP , afri@@ cans organi@@ ze PRP$ NNS IN NP .
and WRB NP VP , they sell NP PP .
NP SBAR VP CC VP .
and i was sure that NP VP .
scot@@ t &apos;s results were full IN NP .
and the challenge with NP , NP , is that , SBAR , NP VP .
we need NP VP .
she said &quot; yes , that &apos;s NP CC NP . &quot;
ADVP IN NP , PRP VBD NP PP .
NP VP and NP VP .
NN IN NP .
and NP PP VBP VP .
NP VP , PRP MD VP .
so this is the gul@@ f of NP , NP .
but NP VP , and NP VP .
we &apos;re starting with something that &apos;s had NP CC NP to begin with .
here are NP VP .
NP VP , SBAR , NP VP .
there &apos;s certainly a common theme about nee@@ ding to make the moment out IN NP .
well i built a fusion re@@ actor when i was NP JJ .
NN NN : INTJ , NP VP
NN : NP VP .
you can recognize PRP RB IN NP .
NP VP VP CC VP .
but may PRP ?
and there &apos;s NP PP that NP VP .
let NP VP .
if NP VP , i think S .
NP : NP and NP VP .
because DT NN WHADVP S -- his approach was totally different IN NP . he sold it to PRP as if NP VP .
now , i &apos;m not going VP , but all NP VP is that ADVP NP VP .
z@@ k : i &apos;d just like to let you all know that this pres@@ entation has been brought IN NP IN NP .
while NP VP , he noticed DT JJ NN .
pac@@ k@@ aging that changes color WRB NP VP .
z@@ ach ka@@ plan + kei@@ th scha@@ cht : NNS CC NNS IN NP
can we produce a men@@ u that &apos;s deli@@ cious IN NP ?
NP VP -- and NP VP .
NP VP -- NP VP -- NP VP .
even though they were im@@ pris@@ oned in NP PP with NP CC NP .
his biggest ob@@ stac@@ le , really , was the market@@ place , which dem@@ ands NP NP .
CC NP VP , NP NP . &quot;
they don NP VP . &quot;
but i can VB NP .
PRP RB VBD VP .
he ta@@ sted PRP and fell IN NP IN NP .
if NP VP , NN IN NP know S . &quot;
but now we need NP SBAR .
let NP VP .
america could VB NP .
we can use some smart NP VP sharing .
most of it now is wa@@ sted and the technologies for saving NP VP .
well , from the coal bur@@ ned IN NP IN NP , only a tent@@ h of the fuel energy actually ends up coming out the pi@@ pe as NN .
and WRB NP VP , you lose NP PP , RB IN NP , RB PP .
in 197@@ 6 , for example , government and industry insi@@ sted that NP VP .
VBP NP .
and third , DT NN IN NP was IN NP IN NP .
IN NP , NP VP , and NP VP .
we will find that NP , ADVP , VP .
if NP VP -- i don NP VP .
RB , NP VP , and NP VP .
SBAR , NP VP , NP VP , NP VP , but ADVP , SBAR , NP VP .
if you look IN NP , you look to the past , or you look inside if NP VP .
that &apos;s WRB NP VP .
NP VP , DT VBD NP . DT VBN .
DT NN , NP VP , NP PP .
and the dri@@ ll ser@@ ge@@ ant starts scre@@ aming IN NP , and telling PRP VP .
no , no , it begins the first time NP VP , &quot; INTJ , NP VP .
the last chap@@ ter in PRP$ NN is called NP NP . &quot;
give PRP IN NP . we &apos;ll RB VB NP ADVP . we &apos;ll RB VB NP ADVP . &quot;
you get DT NN and get IN IN NP .
&quot; NP VP , it &apos;s JJ . &quot;
NP VP , and PP , NP VP .
NNP CC NNP , IN NP , VBP NP .
the days are past when a person , company or brand could RB VB NP -- online ch@@ at@@ ter and sp@@ in mean that if NP VP , there &apos;s NP VP . tim le@@ ber@@ echt off@@ ers three big ideas about accep@@ ting NP PP , even designing IN NP -- and using PRP IN NP IN S .
they want to make NP VP .
but people did not rel@@ ate IN NP .
they were RB VBG NP .
seriously , with DT NN IN NP , i thought NP VP .
i feel that NP VP . &quot;
so we &apos;ve been studying the babies using a techni@@ que that we &apos;re using all over NP CC NP .
ADVP NP VP and NP VP ; PRP VBZ NP PP PP .
WDT NP VP , they &apos;ll VB NP PP .
IN S , NP VP , and PP , NP VP .
but i have to VB NP NP .
so what happened now is , when the water@@ color was flo@@ wing IN NP , the water@@ colors do not mix with the fer@@ ro@@ flu@@ id .
NP VP , but NP VP .
IN NP , EX VBD NP .
and my family brought in a woman whose mother had been a sla@@ ve to take NN IN NP .
and you know , NP VP , NP VP .
but it also takes a soft front -- the capacity to really be open IN NP as NP VP .
may we actu@@ alize DT NN IN NP everywhere .
now , it &apos;s no surprise that SBAR , NP VP . right ?
IN NP , NP VP , NN ?
now , being JJ HYPH JJ pres@@ ents PRP$ JJ NN IN NP , as NP VP .
and i started fre@@ a@@ king out , because i don NP VP .
but what was interesting was , the paki@@ stan@@ i musli@@ m guy -- see he gives a bad name to NP CC NP from NP PP .
he goes , &quot; i &apos;m going IN NP . it &apos;s three miles away .
i go , &quot; NP VP . &quot;
NN NN : SBAR , NP VP : NP VP .
WRB VBZ NP ?
i &apos;m going to show you how terror@@ ism actually inter@@ acts IN NP .
at the same time , while i was intervie@@ wing the red bri@@ ga@@ des , i also discovered that their life was not rul@@ ed IN NP , but actually was rul@@ ed IN NP .
so , i decided that NP VP .
but the great change came , RB RB , IN NP .
now , WRB NP VP , the u.s. money supply is NP PP IN S .
now , the eur@@ o was a new@@ ly born cur@@ ren@@ cy of NP PP , and , IN NP , IN NP .
this has VBN NP NP .
i wanted to live a life WDT NP VP .
i don NP VP .
i don NP VP , generally .
awful , really awful .
when PRP VBD NP ADVP , they found NP VP .
NP ADVP VP and NP VP .
and it &apos;s very difficult to be happy IN NP .
so anyway , today we &apos;ll talk about NP NP , within NP PP .
PRP VBZ ADJP . DT VBZ VP .
can i have the lights off IN NP ?
and so WP NP VP is NP , CC NP .
they were asked VP , VBG NP .
NP PP -- ADVP NP VP .
VB NP PP . IN NP VBZ RB NP .
see , they asked me WDT NP VP .
standing up for NP VP have to VB S .
so we grew up belie@@ ving NP VP .
we were NP , NP , but at NN , while NP VP , we kept VP .
the future states that NP VP .
so , as i say before DT JJ NN , feel not as though NP VP we live IN , RB NP .
IN NP , NP PP .
now , you can apply NP PP .
and the ta@@ il@@ ings pon@@ ds range in NN up IN NP .
this is NP PP .
and the world certainly does not VB NP S .
b@@ har@@ ti see@@ ks to liber@@ ate this everyday c@@ liche , as NP VP , by VP .
he creates NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP . PRP VBP NP .
and so now we can look NP , NP , ADVP and elimin@@ ate NP PP IN NP .
for example , in my first ted@@ talk , i did pro@@ pose that NP VP a week as a planet playing NN NNS .
they help NP VP .
my brain started telling me , NN , NP VP .
even people were playing it for NP PP .
it seems that ADVP , NP VP .
VB !
all right , VB NP : VB NP PP , or VB NP NP thank you by NN , NN , NN CC NN . go !
RB JJ , JJ ?
on the right hand side , that NP there is part of NP SBAR .
by this stage the project had taken IN NP .
the first one NP VP was kni@@ tting .
now mathemati@@ cians have VBN NP .
NP VP : VP .
and that &apos;s true . but it also goes JJR IN NP .
he believed that NP VP .
so you can then map function onto NN , and then find out WP NP VP .
and then what happens is , NP VP you find yourself being sex@@ ually ar@@ ous@@ ed by your mother .
and that &apos;s fortun@@ ate , because NP VP .
RB NP NP IN NP .
DT JJ NN -- S , &quot; CC NP , NP VP .
maybe you can re@@ lie@@ ve NP , NP .
and he says , JJ S . i don NP VP !
and i said -- i got worried , i said , NP , NP VP , what about NP , NP CC NP ?
bear in NP , NP are completely normal IN NP .
now remember -- WRB VBZ NP VP ?
here , you &apos;ve VBD NP .
it &apos;s kind of NP VP secret .
and i think that as NP VP .
what &apos;s more , they are able to walk NN IN NP .
you &apos;re JJ .
he can now cut IN NP .
NNS : NP VP .
this environment brings out JJ NN IN NP .
we &apos;re learning how to communicate IN NP , IN NP .
each one is like a sun with a re@@ tin@@ ue of NP VP .
and , as we &apos;ve learned IN NP , galaxies are held together by NP PP , far smaller even than atom@@ ic nu@@ cle@@ i .
the ge@@ om@@ et@@ ric mean of NP CC NP is 50 kil@@ ogra@@ ms , within NP PP .
and also , WRB NP VP , he or she normally has NP SBAR .
but even in this con@@ cer@@ tin@@ a@@ ed co@@ s@@ mic perspective , our century is very , very special , the first when humans can change NP CC NP .
these human - induced alter@@ ations occu@@ p@@ ying over@@ all less than DT NN IN NP and seem@@ ingly oc@@ curr@@ ing with run@@ away speed ?
what was interesting about the article was people started comm@@ enting on NP , NP .
so some people got this sli@@ p of NP CC NP .
PRP VP CC NP .
perfectly nice NP VP .
NP VP , but PP , NP VP .
and i know what you &apos;re NP VP .
michael nor@@ ton : how to VB NP
in NN IN NP , the ge@@ o@@ political lo@@ gic for PRP$ NN lived on , because NP ADVP VP .
DT NN NN VBD RB ADVP VP .
DT NN IN NP RB ! &quot;
how can PRP VB NP ?
RB , ADVP NP VP , ADVP , NP VP .
UH , ADVP NP VP , but NP VP .
there are NP , NP , NP , NP , NP NP , but put DT IN NP .
this is NP SBAR .
so it &apos;s not that NP VP . it &apos;s not .
it &apos;s sol@@ vable , not by VBG NP , not by VBG NP .
a government depen@@ dent IN NP alone .
PRP VBD NP .
NP VP , and PP , NP VP .
now recently , there &apos;s been NN IN NP .
DT VBZ NP .
i &apos;ll show you a computer model made by NP , NP , that shows how s@@ war@@ ms work .
information can be sent NP RB PP IN NP .
for a long time it was not believed WRB NP VP .
WHNP S VBP NP .
ADVP , NP VP , but NP ADVP VP .
NN : NP , ADVP , ADVP DT JJ ? UH , UH .
NN : RB . NN : NP VP . &quot;
so already , the simul@@ ator is making NP VP .
you don &apos; t see it in NP NP .
so , i want to tell you that NP VP .
in short , the answer is that in the future , in many countries , the col@@ dest NP VP those cro@@ ps have seen IN NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
when PRP VBP PRT NP , this is WP NP VP . it &apos;s pretty simple . it &apos;s DT NN IN NP .
agriculture takes NP PP IN NP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
DT NN IN NP , we learned NN IN NP .
i want to start off by saying , NP , NP VP .
that has not happened at all in NP VP .
three years , and we can &apos; NP VP . crazy .
and it will VB ADJP . and the reason NP VP is , S . DT NNS VBP VP -- NP VP , and ADVP NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP -- CC NP VP -- NP VP , and NP VP and PRP MD VP . and i think RB S .
100 million bucks -- hey , i can go IN NP .
the technology revolution is VBG NP .
now , what is NN ?
PRP VBD NP ADVP .
RB , NP CC NP VBZ ADVP VP .
NP VP ; NP VP .
NP NP VBP PP .
PRP VBZ NP .
so why should we care IN NP ?
RB RB PRP VBP .
in effect , when we give NN NNS NP : NP : you can see that NP VP .
and , IN NP , NP , CONJP NP , VBP ADVP VP .
NP NP , PRP VBZ ADVP VP .
RB , NP VP , and so NP VP ?
the really , truly interesting thing about this is that we can &apos; t take these ob@@ ese mi@@ ce and make them lose more weight than what NP NP VBZ VP .
for the last 20 years i &apos;ve been VBG NP .
went on , and eventually decided to de@@ vote NP , NP , IN NP .
the artist m@@ .@@ c. es@@ cher explo@@ ited that IN NP .
well , let NP VP .
the first move is going VP ?
but PRP VBZ NP .
WRB ? UH , NP NP , NP VP , NP VP . WP IN NP ?
that &apos;s his hair . you get DT NN IN NP .
i think NP VP .
NP VP and ADVP , NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP , SBAR ADVP NP VP .
i know NP PP , IN NP .
she taught girls WDT NP VP , and WP NP VP .
and when she got IN NP she was gre@@ et@@ ed .
PRP VBZ ADJP . PRP$ NNS VBP NP . &quot;
i re@@ jo@@ ice that NP VP .
VBP NP ADVP .
sent IN NP , ad@@ am@@ antly insi@@ sting IN NP .
this is looking directly across NP PP .
DT IN NP said IN S .
and what does this example -- what &apos;s important to keep IN NP ?
and this ble@@ w PRP$ NN . literally . he che@@ cked IN NP .
RB NN VBZ NP .
well , i noticed that NP VP .
first of all , i agree with NP NP , VB NP SBAR .
here &apos;s a JJ JJ .
and CD IN NP said , &quot; come RB . i think NP VP . &quot;
so let NP VP .
so if we want to VB NP , we need look only no far@@ ther than africa VP .
IN NP , NP : NP .
he read 30 years of harvard business re@@ view before st@@ um@@ bling upon an article in 198@@ 6 called NP NP . &quot;
he said , &quot; NP VP . &quot;
it felt like NP VP .
we &apos;ll VP . we &apos;ll NN IN NP .
so we said , &quot; okay , VB NP NP and VB NP NP . okay ? &quot;
NP VP : NP VP .
researchers at e@@ mor@@ y gave children a simple &quot; what do NP VP .
that story perfectly cap@@ tures IN NP NP SBAR , it &apos;s NN S .
a wind@@ shi@@ el@@ d co@@ ating is going to give PRP IN NP .
CC NP VP , but SBAR , NP VP .
and that was that NP VP . &quot;
WRB NP VP , DT NN IN NP inst@@ antly appe@@ ared IN NP .
DT NN NN NN -- S , NNS , sounds , NP VP .
it &apos;s been RB IN NP .
again , we are making NNS IN NP about NP PP , VBG NP PP , and then this electro@@ de is completely underneath the skin down IN NP , and IN NP very much like DT NN JJ NN , we can ad@@ just how much electricity we deliver IN NP .
RB RB PRP VBZ .
so we went RB and implan@@ ted NP PP IN NP .
and indeed , at the top , you &apos;ll see before NP , NP VBP NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
and they can be mod@@ el@@ ed by a spring - mass system that we call the spring mass system because NP VP . it &apos;s actually a po@@ go stick .
this is a collaboration NP VP .
we couldn NP VP . it said to PRP that SBAR , NP VP .
like if NP VP , we &apos;d NN NP NP .
but that &apos;s WP NP VP .
and just recently we &apos;ve made a break@@ through , where we now believe we &apos;re going to be able to create NP , NP , NP . many companies are interested in this .
we also have another problem , which is that women face harder choices between NP CC NP .
i don NP VP .
he re@@ ads NP PP and goes IN NP himself up IN NP QP NNS before NP VP .
but PRP VBZ RB NP .
and she said , &quot; NP VP .
message number three : don &apos; t leave before NP VP .
PRP VBP ADVP RB ADJP .
when people don NP VP , when people don &apos; t follow doctors &apos; orders -- these are behavior problems .
they would VB NP , and if NP VP , you weren NP VP , you &apos;ll eat mus@@ h for NP PP .
this is still the way NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
this is an approach that has been developed IN NP IN NP .
so that &apos;s WDT NP VP .
so we thought NP VP .
but we &apos;re not VBG NP . it &apos;s ADVP VP .
i want to say DT NN IN NP because NP VP the last couple days .
the be@@ e is not VBG NP .
u@@ gh . mini@@ -@@ me .
now , DT JJ NN IN NP is JJ .
NP VP , and ADVP NP VP .
and NP PP VBZ NP .
and so i say that PRP VBP S , but NP VP ; NP VP .
and if NP VP that , fantastic .
NP : NP : VBZ NP .
you should get points for doing DT IN NP .
why go from an a to NP CC NP to a c ?
and we &apos;ve introduced a pro@@ gr@@ ession dynamic into it , where , PP , NP VP , and NP ADVP VP .
this next decade is NP PP .
so you can see : here we are IN NP , and they &apos;re NP VP .
and if NP VP we go .
NP VP , and NP ADVP VP .
NP VP -- ADVP , PP , NP VP -- but NP VP .
i think usually , as NP VP , they find it really hard to VB NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
but NP VP , PP , NP VP .
so , &quot; related sear@@ ches , &quot; right there . you can &apos; NP VP , but we decided NP VP . &quot;
now this rather old photo up there is actually the first project NP VP .
and to VB NP -- this is actually NP : CC NP , IN NP .
what VBZ NP ?
and instead of VP , they used NP VP .
ADVP NP VP , and ADVP NP VP .
so IN NP , this project shows NP PP .
IN NP , PRP VBD NP NP .
people must choose IN NP , VP , RB PP .
the assu@@ mption RB that NP VP hol@@ ds WRB NP VP .
of course , you and i know that NP VP .
it VBZ NP , but IN NP IN NP .
in fr@@ ance , the doctors decided whether and WRB NP VP .
but the history NP CC NP VB NP NP doesn &apos; t always work RP DT NN .
and so one time i was in a beauty sal@@ on , and i was trying to decide IN NP .
NP NP -- and SBAR NP VP . IN NP , PRP VP , CC VP .
then i was so happy that NP VP , and so NP VP .
so i brought to you for the first time on NP NP . it &apos;s not the last one , but it &apos;s a good one for VBG NP .
NP VP , and PP , NP VP .
WHADVP S , PRP VP CC VP . PRP VBD NP S . but CONJP S , NP VP - NP NP .
NN : NP VP .
i mean , how did NP VP ?
VB NP .
and then , the 9@@ 2 nuclear power plants WDT NP VP would fill RP NP PP .
then take it and put it right up against NP PP , and ru@@ b it out from NP PP , like DT .
if you sub@@ stit@@ ute NP , PP NN , it is very true that NP VP now . let &apos;s listen IN PP .
and into NP VP .
this method allows NP VP .
IN NP , NP PP VBD NP .
NP VP , NP VP , NP VP .
NN CD : ADVP , NP VP .
and so every time a new medium arri@@ ves , NP VP , and NP VP , but NP VP , and NP VP .
NP VP and NP VP , NP VP , and ADVP NP VP .
NP VP ; NP VP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
and i do think pattern has the cap@@ ability of VP , but quite seriously , it was DT NN IN NP that NP VP , and i think NP VP .
ro@@ b for@@ bes , the fo@@ under of NP PP , shows a g@@ aller@@ y of NP SBAR . char@@ ming ju@@ x@@ ta@@ posi@@ tions , found NN , NP : NP will open your eyes to NP PP .
RB PRP VBD NP .
and for NP , VP , i dol@@ ed RP NP PP IN NP .
and that &apos;s the way NP VP .
PRP VBD PRT . PRP VBD NP . and DT NN VBD PRT .
would everybody VB NP PP and VB NP ?
ide@@ ally you want VP .
now let NP VP .
that &apos;s NP RB .
clearly the product NP VP got VP .
a single female will lay about up to 100 eg@@ gs at a time , up to QP IN NP .
RB NP NP NP .
i found myself in DT NN IN NP , re@@ cu@@ per@@ ating IN NP .
so , it &apos;s not really simple when somebody as@@ ks you , &quot; where do PRP VB , WRB VBP NP VP , and WRB VBP NP VP ?
no doctor , can i remember , ever asking NP , VP ? &quot;
and NP PP VBP NP .
and i would say NP VP .
i am NP PP . i am NP PP . &quot;
i &apos;m going to start by VBG NP NP : is anyone familiar with the blue al@@ ga@@ e problem ?
NP VP : NP VP .
you &apos;re going to tell me NP VP .
what are we TO VP ? we are fac@@ ed IN NP .
and IN NP , DT NN VBZ VP .
my@@ cor@@ r@@ hi@@ za was used IN NP CC RB IN NP .
ADVP , NP VP : NP VP .
now , typically you &apos;d think that they would all VB NP : like , the cha@@ irs NP VP would all be DT JJ NN .
and here we &apos;ve broken NP RB IN NP , and differ@@ enti@@ ated those neighbor@@ ho@@ ods .
NP , NP PRP MD VP .
finally , i &apos;d like to RB VB NP NP .
if we go NP PP , we can go IN NP , here also in 197@@ 5 , and if you look RB RB , there &apos;s a thin white line through NP PP , and there &apos;s a l@@ one farmer out there in NP PP .
well , DT NN IN NP , DT VBZ ADVP , NP VP , not NP NP , NP VP .
let NP VP .
and yet , we don JJ NN NN IN NP very much .
the green areas here show where NP , VP , VBP ADVP ADJP , probably the ma@@ x@@ im@@ um NP VP , but NP VP you should be able VP .
we need to face IN NP . &apos; a global crisis in agriculture .
and there &apos;s nothing NP VP .
and i thought NP VP .
so it &apos;s vast . but it should come IN NP , and the a@@ ster@@ is@@ k is that NP VP .
they &apos;re going to ed@@ dy IN NP .
RB , NP VP , and NP VP .
there are also some children who are born IN NP .
NP VP , and ADVP NP VP .
VP , PP , we still have NP SBAR .
and i challenge anybody in the room to make NP VP .
NP VP , and PP , NP VP .
i could work PRP RB IN NP .
NN : CC NP VP .
here &apos;s am@@ anda using NP VP .
but look IN NP .
to@@ d@@ d ku@@ i@@ ken : a pro@@ s@@ thetic arm WDT NP VP
also , research within the continent is a lot easier to condu@@ ct NP CC NP .
public accoun@@ t@@ ability needs to be pro@@ mot@@ ed through NP CC NP by NP CC NP as JJ .
now , there are NP CC NP RB .
and , RBR RB , PRP VBP ADJP .
where NP VP and NP VP , it means NP VP .
and so we have this pengu@@ in project . the wild@@ life conser@@ vation society has fund@@ ed me along with a lot of NP PP to be able VP .
because NP VP haven &apos; t solved DT NN IN NP .
NN NNS RB VBN VP .
here &apos;s a female that &apos;s IN NP . she &apos;s got NN .
IN NP , NP ADVP VP , CC ADVP VP .
as NP VP , russi@@ a is RB NP PP .
they set RP NP CC NP .
specifically , it tar@@ gets NP , NP .
so what can we do VP ?
what might ? i believe that what might VB NP is infrastructure .
and i as@@ sure you it &apos;s NP PP as NP VP .
IN NP , CD JJ NNS VBD NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
many people think the lines on DT NN no longer VP , but para@@ g k@@ han@@ na says NP VP . using NNS IN NP , he explains DT NN VP CC VP .
and next you &apos;re going VP .
that &apos;s WP NP VP . and you would never know .
now you &apos;ve NP VP .
so it &apos;s RB JJ , and it makes NP PP , that NP VP , so why would PRP VB VP ?
that &apos;s WRB NP VP . that &apos;s WRB NP VP .
and that &apos;s DT NN RB IN NP , as NP VP .
although you &apos;re looking for a drug that can VB NP , what you could do now pretty well in the lab , if you were allowed eth@@ ically , is start a human life from scrat@@ ch with alter@@ ed genes that would make NP VP longer ?
if NP VP , NNS IN NP tend VP .
as NP VP , it &apos;s JJ S .
here &apos;s another good article about NP VP .
which leads PRP IN NP .
i can see NP VP .
ADVP VP , NP VP NP VP .
NN VBZ ADJP .
you can train a fly to avoid NP , VP .
modern psychiat@@ ric drugs treat NP PP , but neuro@@ biolog@@ ist david ander@@ son belie@@ ves IN NP . he ill@@ umin@@ ates JJ NN WHNP S . how &apos;s NP VP ? for a start , by VBG NP flies an@@ gry .
ADVP NP VP , and PP NP VP .
so the problem WDT NP VP is that , PP , NP VP .
RB PRP VBP .
but not all patients on the transp@@ l@@ ant VB NP are so fortun@@ ate .
and in my mind , i realized as DT JJ NN that NP VP .
and so guess what , scientists around the world and in the lab@@ s are ra@@ cing to conver@@ t aging adult cells -- aging adult cells from you and me -- they are ra@@ cing to re@@ program these cells back into NP NP .
stem cells may be used to deliver growth fac@@ tors to re@@ pair dama@@ ged heart muscle or be differ@@ enti@@ ated IN NP VP .
and here are the results of this wonderful project that is NP PP .
so what &apos;s VP ?
but here &apos;s what &apos;s VP .
yeah .
and for DT NN IN NP , i would encoura@@ ge NP VP .
but we don NP VP , since NP VP .
first , it &apos;s RB NP PP .
you &apos;re familiar with these cells because they are the ones that fru@@ strate you when you try to NP NP .
whenever a fly reach@@ es NP PP , it has to VB NP .
SBAR , NP VP , NP ADVP VP , and ADVP NP VP .
DT JJ NN IN NP , IN NP , is RB RB S .
and it &apos;s depen@@ dent on passi@@ ve patients who just take PRP and don NP VP .
thomas bat@@ u@@ ik : INTJ , NP .
and you just saw NP PP IN NP IN NP .
NP VP , and ADVP , NP VP . &quot;
these population studies WDT NP VP have created NP PP , but the problem is that NP VP . that &apos;s what VBZ S .
so &quot; thank NP VP feel li@@ kes a really tri@@ te word , but thank you from the bottom of NP PP .
that &apos;s NP , NP , NP RB IN NP , ADVP VP .
oh . one thing NP VP , look at NN .
and when i went back to research this , i realized that one of NP PP , from na@@ than , we &apos;ve talked IN NP .
for NP SBAR , that &apos;s NP VP . but it &apos;s IN NP .
so we can VB NP .
but then as it gets closer to DT NN , look at the close - up . and see if you can see NP NP .
so i will spend DT JJ NN IN NP .
well , the problem is that NP VP .
NP VP -- NP VP .
PRP VBD NP S .
we &apos;ve actually changed the temperature in NP NP .
and it been growing IN NP .
the coral can take us back NP PP .
so i &apos;ll close IN NP .
now , what that means is that NP PP VBP VP , that &apos;s the reason that they &apos;re not able to respond or ada@@ pt IN NP .
NP VP : S NP VP .
he said , SBAR , ADVP NP VP .
NP VP , but S , VP NP , NP VP , NP VP .
this something else is NP PP .
and that question is NP : S .
and if PRP VBP NP PRN right there , notice that S NP VP is affected IN NP .
and now string theory VBZ ADVP and VBZ , INTJ , NP , NP , NP , DT ADVP IN NP , but only IN S .
what i want VP is not that NN VBZ NP , but why is context everything .
DT CD IN NP comes IN NP , IN NP .
so , if NP VP .
but i &apos;m not going to change NN IN NP , IN NP .
VP , NN , ADVP NP .
and NP PP . NP VP , and NP VP .
and you &apos;ll see NP VP .
so , now , what i want to do : i &apos;m going to put the middle nine sur@@ faces here under yellow ill@@ um@@ ination by simply putting DT NN IN NP .
so if you look IN NP IN NP , it &apos;s a trade - off .
and i think that NP NP .
so you can imagine WRB NP VP .
there NP NP WHNP S , but doesn &apos; t make NP VP .
PRP VBP NP .
i was born IN NP .
intui@@ tive is RB NP PP .
NP , NP , VBZ NP .
strong feelings can VB NP .
NP VP , NN VBZ PP .
i said , &quot; well , that NP ADJP .
JJ JJ NN VBP NP . MD RB VP .
and let NP VP .
jo@@ ach@@ im de pos@@ ada : VP VBP NP !
NP VP ; NP VP .
and we &apos;ve already started NN IN NP .
let NP VP .
and my country reli@@ es IN NP IN NP , that &apos;s clear .
my point is that NP VP .
i think NP VP .
so what can we learn IN NP ?
NP VP , PRP VBP , UCP , NP .
NP VP -- NP VP . &quot;
and ADVP , NP VP , and NP VP .
how long have they been standing IN X NP ?
RB , DT NN RB VBZ NP .
this subje@@ cts food to NP NP , and oh boy , does PRP VB NP .
NP VP , MD NP VP ? NP VP , and NP VP , ADVP ? NP VP , ADJP !
now , this is what ty@@ ran@@ no@@ sau@@ rus re@@ x looks like IN NP .
RB , NP VP , and NP VP ? &quot;
having expla@@ ined those , that will set up for what i think will be NP PP .
so what you can tell is you can tell DT NN IN NP by VP .
but sometimes you can VB NP PP .
i mean , i see patients dying every day because NP VP .
so this is NP PP .
the problem is that , PP , NP VP .
ADVP NP VP , but NP VP . PRP VP CC VP .
RB VBP NP ADVP .
febru@@ ary 4@@ th , we po@@ sted PRP IN NP . this was IN NP-TMP .
stage one is a group where people syste@@ matically se@@ ver relationships from func@@ tional tri@@ bes , and then pool together with people who think like NP VP .
if that &apos;s WRB NP VP , imagine what NN IN NP would VB VP .
here is the greatest challenge NP VP .
there is , IN NP , DT NN .
PRP VBP ADJP ! WP VP ? england ! &quot;
one of the people NP VP was frank j@@ ord@@ an , former ma@@ yo@@ r of san francisco . before that he was ch@@ ie@@ f of NN IN NP .
pretty much everybody else who VBZ NP .
i &apos;m going to VB NP .
it &apos;s why they leave lights on IN NP .
it was not until the 14@@ th century that an itali@@ an pain@@ ter recogni@@ zed the la@@ p as NP , VP .
apri@@ co@@ t hal@@ ves like NP PP .
and it &apos;s too cer@@ e@@ bra@@ l IN NP WRB NP VP .
and in that light , for the religious , compassion also brings us into the terri@@ tory of myster@@ y -- encoura@@ ging us not just to see beauty , but perhaps also to look IN NP IN NP , IN NP , IN NP .
NP VP ; NP VP .
but he watched NP VP .
ra@@ ch@@ el na@@ om@@ i re@@ men is a better doctor because IN NP disease .
but i rec@@ ited a che@@ er . i rec@@ ited a che@@ er along IN NP .
it &apos;s different from VP .
CC NP VP ; NP VP .
this is no surprise though if NP VP .
and they fe@@ ature IN NP RB JJ NNS .
and ADVP IN NP .
this is especially important IN NP too .
and then i &apos;ll VP , CC VP that NP VP .
so , NP PP , and now NP PP , is VP .
IN NP , PRP VBP S . IN NP , JJ PP , DT NN VP : VP , VP . but IN NP , NP PP VBZ VP . IN NP , PRP VBD VP .
what i mean IN NP is that IN NP , DT NN VBZ NP .
CD NN IN NP has VBN NP .
you have TO VP than NP VP , because NP VP . &quot; and now he began TO VP .
NP VP but SBAR NP VP ? &quot;
i started it with NP PP .
and PRP VBD NP , S , do you believe that NP VP ?
i don NP VP .
it &apos;s RB RB more , VBG NP .
WRB NP VP , it sounds ADJP , ADJP .
now , they &apos;re NP IN NP .
but he doesn NP VP .
last year , i was invited to speak at NP HYPH NP .
if NP VP , you make NNS .
and i don NP VP .
her mother had not gone IN NP .
and ADVP , NP VP and NP VP .
and finally , i want to convince you that NP VP and that SBAR , NP VP .
but NP VP -- and NP VP .
well the wrong side of her body is in ban@@ da@@ ges because the surge@@ on has per@@ formed a major operation on NP PP .
the mira@@ cle of your mind isn NP VP .
WRB NP VP , we love VP .
and to me , if you really want to re@@ discover NN , you need to step outside of NP PP and look RB IN NP and look RP IN NP and be JJ S , &quot; INTJ , NP VP .
one of the ir@@ on@@ ies of this whole system is we &apos;re discus@@ sing what to do IN NP . we don &apos; t even know what oil is . we don &apos; t know where oil comes from . i mean , literally , it &apos;s still a source of debate what NP PP VBZ and where it comes from . the best assu@@ mption , and one of the best gu@@ esses in this stuff , is that this stuff comes out of this stuff , that these things absor@@ b sun@@ light , rot IN NP IN NP , and you get these black ri@@ vers .
what is this ? this is DT JJ NN IN NP . that &apos;s CD NN old . you will see NN IN NP .
i happened to buy DT NN IN NP IN S .
but given NP PP , i ended RP IN NP RB RB .
they didn NP ADVP VP .
RB as NP VP , i got VP .
actually , in fact , if you look IN NP , many dic@@ tion@@ aries define pur@@ suit as to NP PP . &quot;
NP VP -- NP VP .
in fact , as leaders , what we need to learn is that we can influence the quality of DT NN IN NP by creating DT NNS IN NP VP .
NNP : RB RB . CD , CD , CD .
right ? if you go down below on a boat , your inner e@@ ars are you telling you you &apos;re VP . your eyes , because it &apos;s moving IN NP IN NP , say i &apos;m standing still .
now here , i want to share DT NN IN NP . right ?
b@@ l : &quot; can you help NP , NP ? &quot; WP NP VP , right ?
ADVP NP VP , and NP VP .
b@@ l : this is DT NN IN NP . right . okay .
NP VP -- NP VP .
we feel so good IN NP .
bi@@ om@@ i@@ mi@@ c@@ ry , which is something that VBZ NP , win@@ ds up being a very important social justice idea .
california has NP PP .
it was NP CC NP .
it &apos;s bad enough IN NP ?
NP VP -- NP VP . and NP VP -- and NP VP .
wonderful engine .
twenty - three percent said , NP INTJ , ADVP PP . &quot;
NP VP , PRP RB VBP .
what dr. sol@@ jac@@ ic figured out how to do was separate the co@@ ils in a trans@@ former to a greater distance than the size of NP VP an oper@@ a sing@@ er sh@@ at@@ ters a glass on the other side of the room .
and NP , NP .
VB , you get NP PP . you want VP .
and NN RB RB .
so what happens IN NP ?
we want to VP , RB VP , NP .
VBP NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
they &apos;re JJ . they &apos;re JJ .
so what do we make IN NP ?
NP VP , yet NP VP . &quot;
ho@@ spi@@ ce was IN NP .
NP VP , and ADVP NP VP .
well , we collect data IN NP , IN NP , IN NP , IN NP .
DT NN VBZ NP .
microsoft &apos;s NP VP , moving RP , RB and IN NP IN NP .
you need also NN NN , RB IN NP , in order VP .
this is NP PP .
by that compar@@ ison , democracy looks very , very good in NP PP .
this is NP PP .
these are NP VP .
but ne@@ ver@@ th@@ eless , the system has moved IN NP , moved in DT ADJP NN .
i believe that NP VP .
i &apos;ve been spending DT NN IN NP VBG PP , because NP VP .
and SBAR , NP VP , but NP VP .
NP VP , VBZ NP PP .
and darwin kept these cop@@ i@@ ous not@@ e@@ books where he wrote down every little idea NP VP , every little hun@@ ch .
and ADVP NP VP , and NP VP .
could PRP VB NP ?
NP VP , but NP VP .
so we &apos;re living IN NP , especially IN NP .
PRP VBP NP .
RB , DT VBZ NP .
the dy@@ stop@@ ia that wor@@ ries me is a universe in which a few geni@@ uses inv@@ ent NP CC NP and NP PP are emplo@@ yed giving them mas@@ sages .
there NNS JJ IN NP up there .
CD IN NP .
and this one &apos;s DT JJS NN NN IN NP , and QP IN NP will VB PP , and NN VBZ NP , and NP VP , and NP VP .
the small idea is , let NP VP .
it de@@ pri@@ ves NN IN NP .
NP VP and NP VP .
and this is really what i want VP IN NP -- IN NP .
so , this really changed my view of looking IN NP .
tumor cells can travel IN NP .
so , is it possible that the tumor cells are going IN NP , but once in NN IN NP , m@@ yo@@ d acts IN NP and causes NP VP ?
and the grandmother had never let NP ADVP VP .
and remember this picture , because NP VP , but NP VP .
and i said , &quot; PRP VBP ADJP , and NP VP , and NP VP . &quot;
so , i went back to korea , and i went back to NP NP , and she was gone .
and the more i tried talking to PRP , the less friend@@ ly NP VP .
i just think that -- WDT NP NP VP , she has NP PP . &quot;
and NP VP she made RP NP PP .
and the third night , we came back , we &apos;d just gone out to NN , where NP VP , and NP VP said , &quot; there &apos;s DT JJ JJ NNS IN NP ton@@ ight , so if NP VP , there &apos;s a room there . &quot;
and the whole room filled IN NP .
and i remember , NP VP -- S , NP VP .
NP VP , and ADVP NP VP .
gene even did a little ti@@ le work in the kitchen , which was that , NP ADVP PP , NP VP . &quot;
VBP NP NP .
NP VP , and VP .
IN NP , ADVP IN NP , NP PP MD VP .
NP PP VBP NP .
so the question is : VP NP , or VBZ NP NP ?
DT NN IN NP actually can VB NP PP .
can you imagine WRB JJ NP VP ?
let NP VP .
RB , NP VP , and NP-TMP ADVP NP VP .
not NP PP , but NP CC NP WDT VP .
RB NP NP IN NP .
un@@ aids have done NP ADJP , RB , IN NP .
h@@ ans ro@@ s@@ ling un@@ v@@ ei@@ ls new data visu@@ als that un@@ tan@@ gle NP PP VBZ NP . he argu@@ es that pre@@ vent@@ ing trans@@ mis@@ sions -- not drug treat@@ ments -- is the key to VBG NP .
it &apos;s based on VBG NP .
NP VP , because NP VP .
let NP VP .
RB , EX VBZ NP ADVP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
NP VP , and SBAR , NP VP .
that &apos;s RB JJ .
and that &apos;s all NP VP .
so what DT NN VBZ is that NP VP .
these can be grou@@ ped IN NP .
so i &apos;ve color@@ ed in the gl@@ y@@ cin@@ es again in JJ , NP PP . and you can see that NP VP , and NP VP .
what you see here on this tou@@ g@@ hn@@ ess graph is the higher the black do@@ t is on NP , NP .
to bor@@ row from the wri@@ t@@ ings of NP VP , silk is terri@@ fic .
fli@@ ck@@ r is NP SBAR .
you notice we NP VP .
and NP , NP , NP , VBZ NP .
this is NP VP . right ?
right ? so , when institutions are told NP VP , and that NP VP , they go through something a little bit like DT NML NNS -- -- of reaction , being told NP VP .
the inv@@ ent@@ ors don NP VP .
there are people in the states right now t@@ ying themselves into kn@@ ots , trying to figure out whether or not NP VP .
it was produced by VP . and dou@@ b@@ t@@ less the intelligence communities of the world are doing the same work today for NP PP .
so a bak@@ er , and a good bak@@ er , knows how to pull or draw forth the in@@ her@@ ent sugar tra@@ pped IN NP .
that &apos;s the challenge . okay , so , ADVP , NP -- IN NP , let NP VP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
and then we have stage 12 , which the text@@ books call NP , NP VBP NP . &quot;
NP VP , but NP VP .
bacteria is in RB , VBG NP , turning PRP IN NP .
it &apos;s used IN NP .
and i &apos;m not kid@@ ding , i just think NP VP .
they &apos;re NP VP .
it &apos;s NP PP .
let NP VP .
i &apos;ve decided , ultimately , that NP VP .
so half the time , she ac@@ ted as if she liked NP CC NP IN NP -- RB IN NP .
if we look IN NP , but ADVP VBG NP , it turns out that there &apos;s NP PP .
and at least until NP VP , we &apos;re still po@@ pping DT NNS IN NP .
then they test that NP .
NP VP , DT VBP NP .
oh .
and we even know something about the way NP VP .
al@@ ison g@@ op@@ nik : WP VBP NP VP ?
now , the only way to get IN NP is to RB VB NP and to VB NP .
DT VP , VP .
ADVP , NP VP , but NP VP .
and RB , RB VBZ NP .
RB , NP VP and NP VP .
at the moment , doing something like NP PP would take you probably DT NN IN NP .
RB NP NP PRP MD VP .
we do have one un@@ inten@@ tional dan@@ cer actually , the last thing NP VP .
it &apos;s NP VP .
i remember NP VP .
and my argument &#91; is &#93; that NP VP .
and you &apos;ll get paid IN NP . you can think about PRP , if NP VP .
WDT NP VP .
let NP VP .
there are NP SBAR .
pal@@ m is RB , ADVP IN NP , JJ IN NP .
i write NP SBAR .
i made a fortun@@ e over IN NP .
IN NP -- NP VP , and NP VP .
NNP : VBP NP ADVP .
and the dan@@ ger is that NP VP .
and i would say that NP VP .
we &apos;ll hear NP JJR IN NP gore very shor@@ tly .
it &apos;s NP PP .
PRP VBP NP . PRP VBP NP .
and finally , i think NP VP .
i think NP VP .
how hard is it going VP ?
i think NP VP , and i think S , and i think S .
NP VP , and NP ADVP VP .
in this ca@@ ve , great areas are covered by NP , CONJP NP .
in order to access these sub-@@ surface environments WDT NP VP , we &apos;re very interested in developing the tools to VB NP .
so , we &apos;re talking about things like in@@ fl@@ at@@ able lin@@ ers that can con@@ form to the complex to@@ po@@ logi@@ cal shape on NP PP , foamed - NP NP to deal with NP , NP .
but when NP VP and NP VP , psych@@ ologists have found IN S . &quot;
and so it is with NP , NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
and so before NP VP , we had VP .
and that &apos;s WP NP VP .
but as NP VP , they shed NNS .
NP VP , and NP VP .
because NP VP .
WRB VBP NP VP ? with NP , PP ! NP NP VBZ NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
they did VB NP NP .
i did NP PP IN NP .
and TO VP -- i couldn NP VP , but NP VP , and NP VP .
most of DT NNS WDT NP VP , if NP VP they start VP .
it was NP , NP .
and in particular , i think NP VP .
it &apos;s IN NP IN NP RB , WHNP S .
now , if you take NP PP , you can think about PRP , if NP VP .
no , we want one or two mon@@ sters on DT NN IN NP .
RB , NP : NP .
and WP NP VP , we can VB NP .
let NP VP .
and through this work , i hope to better understand DT JJ NNS IN NP , so that NP VP and better manage our health in DT NN .
and so previous studies had only focused IN NP .
so i took DT NN IN NP VP .
RB , NN VBZ RB NP .
ADVP NP , and NP VP , NP , NP .
NP PP and NP PP wish NP VP .
this is a construction hel@@ met that i received two years ago at NP PP .
but i &apos;m going to reduce DT IN NP , IN NP .
SBAR NP VP and NP VP ?
DT JJ NN VBD ADVP ADJP .
you &apos;re going down into our lo@@ bby , go through NP PP , whether NP PP or not , up through the sta@@ ir that leads PRP IN NP .
and the solution in terms of the bal@@ con@@ ies was to use something that we all know IN NP .
DT NN VBZ NP .
and VP that here is NP SBAR .
and i really loved NP VP .
&quot; NP VP . &quot;
so these are some ne@@ wer projects that actually aren NP ADVP VP .
we &apos;re very used IN NP .
this graph WDT NP VP is meant VP .
so , you have NP , CC NP .
he had this amazing series of NP VP .
one of NP PP is DT NN IN NP that NP VP , and then they send these people home once NP VP .
but i pre@@ fer IN NP .
and you never think NP VP .
and â â DT NN NN of had NP VP . &quot;
NN NN : NP PP
now of course , as history has gone by , it &apos;s been natural for there to be a certain amount of NN IN NP .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing in NP VP .
if NP VP NP VP , think IN NP . &quot;
&quot; many do not know DT NN or NN NN , can not write gra@@ m@@ matically -- &quot; NP VP , not just in 195@@ 6 . 19@@ 17 , connec@@ tic@@ ut scho@@ ol@@ teacher .
and then the third thing would be , please VB NP NP .
JJ NN : NN NN
it is extremely un@@ likely NP VP .
and the same is true IN NP .
and yet , nobody listen@@ ed IN NP .
RB , RB ADVP , NP , NP , NP VBP NP .
but you need to look IN NP .
it makes NP ADJP .
the problem that i want to talk IN NP about is really the problem of : how does CD NN NN IN NP ?
that &apos;s WP NP VP .
NP , SBAR , IN NP MD VP .
there is a very important issue here , which is that because it &apos;s NP , NP , it prin@@ ts colors . that &apos;s what color pr@@ inter@@ s do .
so , you take NP PP , no further manipu@@ lations , NP VP , NP VP , lets NP VP , and you get NP PP RB PP RB .
and , PP NP VP . &quot;
and NP VP , and PP NP VP .
traditional lab tests for NN NN can be ADJP PP RBS IN NP . george whit@@ es@@ i@@ des &apos; NP VP . & lt ; NP CC NP : & NN ; / em & gt ;
and we think people like this probably don NP VP .
and so we can look IN NP .
but you see NP CC NP .
and you interact NP : NP INTJ , NP you might not know .
i &apos;m NP VP .
PRP VP , VP , S .
so IN NP , in NP , NP , NP , the bar@@ ber surge@@ on had VBN NP PP .
there &apos;s NP PP and NP PP .
and to her , that spoke of NP PP that NP VP .
NP , PRN , NP VP , PRP VBZ NP .
i would per@@ c@@ uss DT NN . i would listen IN NP .
modern medicine is in NP PP . physi@@ cian and writer abra@@ ham ver@@ gh@@ ese descri@@ bes our strange new world WRB NP VP .
and the answer is , if NP ADJP IN NP , yes .
and in all cases we have to ask -- what VBZ NP ?
in NP PP , he had NP SBAR .
NNS IN NP are JJ S .
i guess NP VP .
it was in NP , VP , NP NP IN NP . &quot;
NP ADVP VP , and CC NP VP .
VP : NP VP .
over the next five years we hope to save NP PP .
but what do we do IN NP ?
and then he went IN NP and did PRP RB .
and you can build DT JJ NN IN NP .
and people in NP VP .
so some people will go out and get people to be IN NP .
NP VP , S VP .
&quot; what would happen if NP VP ? &quot;
VP VBZ NP NP .
the sen@@ sor would have VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
and ADVP , NP VP , and NP VP .
NP , ADVP , IN NP is RB JJ .
so , for NN , there is NP PP .
and why does sex make NP VP ?
what is NP PP ?
and in NP CC NP , lies IN NP .
is it a place where you can VB NP ?
it won NP VP . there is NP PP .
child number two comes RB but looks IN NP .
PRP VBZ NP .
NP VP , but ADVP NP VP .
NP VP , ADVP NP VP -- and NP VP .
it meant that NP VP .
NP PP VBD ADVP .
and in some ways , the music that NP VP works perfectly .
and i thought : well , if this is a model for creation , if NP VP , and if NP VP , and if NP VP , is that how it works ?
and had such -- it was an eye - opening experience to hear NP VP .
but this is not the first time WDT NP VP .
and yet he says , &quot; NP VP . &quot;
you &apos;ve seen NP VP .
and NP VP , and NP VP .
unbe@@ ar@@ able psych@@ ological pres@@ sur@@ es bear RP IN NP .
it &apos;s difficult for them to understand that NP VP .
NP VP , and PP NP VP .
essentially , he said DT : NML , NP VP , even if NP VP .
i couldn NP VP .
life is NP , NP CC NP .
are PRP VBG NP ?
i experience RB .
NNS , NN .
the women &apos;s NP VP .
she &apos;s RB JJ .
today , we &apos;ve worked IN NP .
so i will VB NP .
i want to look back 20 years from now and see that there &apos;s NP VP .
NNP : NP VP .
li@@ ck@@ li@@ der for@@ es@@ a@@ w computers doing all the rou@@ tin@@ i@@ z@@ able work that was requi@@ red to pre@@ p@@ are the way for NP CC NP .
NP VP : NP , NP , NP . NP VP , and NP ADVP VP .
these foreign figh@@ ters had left their families in NP , NP CC NP TO VP .
the human goal here was to identify NNS IN NP based IN NP .
and the reality of NP SBAR is NP VP .
play a sport with NP PP .
ADVP NP VP , but VP ; PRP VBZ NP .
and that , i think , VBZ NP ADJP S .
as DT JJ NN IN NP , i am twice as likely IN NP .
so how did things get RB JJ IN NP ?
who prof@@ its ? does anything justi@@ fy WP NP VP ?
and they provide NP PP !
and we are operating IN NP .
IN NP , PRP VBD ADVP VP .
PP IN NP , don NP VP .
NP VP and NP VP . &quot;
it seems that NP VP .
and SBAR , NP VP or NP VP .
RB PRP VBD NP .
again , it &apos;s useful to think IN NP .
this is completely different IN NP .
i want to talk IN NP .
NP VP ; NP VP .
all right ? ADVP NP VP , and NP VP . right ?
hopefully , really understand DT NN IN NP , WHADVP S , live IN NP IN NP . so -- VBN ADVP , and RB NN JJ VBD . they went other places .
DT NNS VBD ADVP , and NP VP , and NP VP .
NP VP ADJP ?
NNP NNP : NP VP
now as PRP VBD VP , cas@@ c@@ ading IN NP , were NP : NP and NP PP .
in effect , the cancer cell was for@@ getting NP VP and becoming a normal cell .
and NP VP , RB , ADJP .
the first is if NP VP -- that NP VP .
one thing NP VP is simply ad@@ mi@@ re PRP .
because if NP VP , they would VB VP .
that &apos;s PRP$ NN IN NP .
and this energy , according IN NP , exer@@ ts NP PP .
that impli@@ cation was studied by NN back IN NP .
that &apos;s the region WRB NP VP .
but we now know enough about DT NN IN NP to say NP RBR .
or maybe the big bang is not NP PP .
i had RB VBN NP .
NP VP , so NP VP .
UH VB .
so , here , whatever movement NP VP is actually repli@@ cated IN NP .
i VBD NP ADVP , and VBD NP , VBD NP PP .
the camera is actually not only understanding your hand mov@@ ements , but , interest@@ ingly , is also able to understand what objects NP VP .
and why only computers ? we can just play IN NP .
NN : NP VP . NNS IN NP .
RB PRP VBD NP .
if you don NP VP , you &apos;ve got VP .
you can VB NP .
the first one is , NP VP .
you can imagine how people get happy with NP VP .
i &apos;ll get IN NP RB NP PP .
that is JJ , that means NP VP .
in@@ ca sculp@@ tures are re@@ gar@@ ded as NP PP , while NP VP .
NP NP , IN NP , had DT NNS IN S .
beautiful sh@@ ell ne@@ ck@@ l@@ ac@@ es that look PP NP VP and NP ADJP , as well as o@@ ch@@ re body paint , have been found from around 100,000 years ago .
INTJ , NP -- NP VP .
PRP VBP NP .
the system is also smart enough to figure out the sa@@ fest way to VB NP .
RB PRP VBZ ADVP NP .
you must be out IN NP . &quot;
i was leaving NP SBAR , hum@@ ming IN NP , f@@ um@@ bling IN NP RB IN S before , when suddenly i heard S , &quot; PRP VBZ VP . &quot;
it was at DT NN that NP VP .
i used VP but NP PP IN NP .
to par@@ ap@@ hr@@ ase cha@@ ve@@ z , once social change begins , NP VP .
what they remember is , of course , the great tri@@ um@@ ph , that NP VP , and NP VP , and that DT NN VBD VP .
and that makes it extra@@ ordin@@ arily interesting IN NP .
but better -- WP VP is that NP VP .
you see the red glo@@ w in their eyes , which is NP PP .
they look like , RB IN NP .
NP VP , and PP , NP VP , we want VP .
and DT VBZ NP S , PP .
i mean , think about it : the care NP VP is really important , so if PRP VBZ NP S , it really doesn NP VP .
so we called PRP NN NN . and so this is NP : NP , NP , NP , NP .
in fact , you can see NP VP .
and if NP VP , you can RB VB NP PP .
the first half will be per@@ formed IN NP ADVP IN NP .
and what , if anything , do NP VP ?
my father , who had f@@ ought IN NP , could not save his own sister from this suffering .
&quot; NP VP .
i see traditional music like a kind of re@@ bel@@ li@@ on , in which people can really speak NP , RB NP IN NP .
but no , for the pro@@ test , they d@@ ressed all in NP , NP .
women like sa@@ ken@@ a and lea@@ h and la@@ y@@ ma have hum@@ bled me and changed me and made me realize that NP VP .
we MD VP and VBP NP , ADVP , IN NP .
and i thought , RB ADVP , NP , NP VP , nor VBP NP NP . i am mer@@ ely a story@@ t@@ eller . &quot;
RB WP MD NP VP ?
they were together while VP .
and there are NP , CC NP , VP .
and the religious police im@@ pos@@ es NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
and this is a question , NP VP , WDT VP .
that &apos;s an experience that NP VP .
NNP NNP : NN CC NN IN NP
it VBZ NP , VBZ NP ADVP .
and anti@@ body sta@@ in@@ ings like this one can be used to understand NP PP .
dar@@ fu@@ r may have sli@@ pped IN NP , but the killing and dis@@ plac@@ ement there continu@@ es as well , and the she@@ er human mis@@ ery that NP VP is very hard TO VP .
th@@ us , even though NP VP VBZ NP , the fact that NP VP , is good news .
but then , is NP NP , or does S ?
both success@@ es and fail@@ ures teach NP NP SBAR .
as NP PP , i &apos;ve VBN NP PP .
NP VP ; NP VP .
IN NP , NN VBD NP . NP VP ; NP VP .
NP VP , but ADVP NP VP .
and where it doesn &apos; t , as IN NP in NN , mars is still not very far .
so in NN , &quot; NP VP , so we ren@@ am@@ ed DT NML NN NN and created NP , SBAR NN .
and we per@@ si@@ sted , and we got 4@@ 50 guys growing mu@@ sta@@ ches , and together we raised 5@@ 4@@ ,000 dollars , and we don@@ ated every cent of that to the pro@@ state cancer foundation of NN , and that repres@@ ented at NP NP they &apos;d ever received .
so what we did was , NP VP , and NP VP , if NP VP , we could raise infin@@ itely more money glob@@ ally than we could just in NN . and that money fu@@ els research , and that research will get us to a cure .
so we pil@@ ed IN NP , and DT VBZ NP , and NP VP , and NP VP ? &quot;
and so we said , right , we &apos;d re@@ defined NN . we need to re@@ define the way NP VP . how do we do that ?
he could see what was happening to his forest , to his environment , because he was taken under his grand@@ father &apos;s wing when he was only two years old to begin to learn about NP CC NP .
NP VP and NP VP ?
we have VP .
RB NP NP RB .
NP VP , and NP VP . &quot;
they have a sense of NP CC NP .
NP VP , NP VP , NP VP .
IN NP VBD NP , NP .
you should not be s@@ is@@ y@@ ph@@ us , who roll@@ s NP IN NP RB VP .
you see , the indi@@ ans also had a river that separ@@ ates NP PP IN NP .
NP PP VBD NP .
RB VBZ NP .
and i would see DT NN IN NP , WRB NP VP .
so , there is nothing right or wrong in what you do IN NP .
and so the next time you meet NP : S .
you &apos;re afraid if NP VP .
PRP VBP SBAR ? RB VBZ DT JJ NN .
NP VP , and S , NP VP , NP VP , and S , CC S .
what do you want NP VP ?
&quot; look kid . NP VP -- CC . &quot;
and that &apos;s why NP VP VP : unless , that most ev@@ o@@ ca@@ tive of all english words -- unless .
you may rec@@ all a year ago when a fire@@ stor@@ m er@@ up@@ ted after NP VP .
so it &apos;s easy to see this tumor in NP PP .
and so@@ on@@ er or later , we &apos;re going to have to accept the fact that NP VP .
ADVP NP VP , and NP VP .
here &apos;s DT NN IN NP .
PRP RB VBP S , and ADVP NP VP , and NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
i can look IN NP .
or should we VB NP , VB NP and VB NP ADVP ?
what VBZ NP ?
NP VP ; NP VP .
if NP VP , you have DT NN JJ NN .
not just because it ran@@ g earlier , but i &apos;m going to take it because NP VP .
what VBZ NP ?
or like k@@ ant , did NP VP ? &quot;
NP-TMP , NP VP , DT VBZ NP .
PRP VBZ NP .
and DT NN VBZ ADJP .
definitely not perfect . so you would probably shu@@ t PRP , IN NP .
you have to know that NN , NP NP VBZ RB VP .
i designed it to VB NP S .
RB , JJ NN .
because NP VP .
now we can VB NP .
so , if NP VP , VBG NP was DT ADJP NN , IN NP .
and in NP PP , VB NP was NP PP .
he was really a curious sight VP .
went RP IN NP and said : VP , NP .
now , the group NP ADVP VP , though , are DT NNS IN NP .
NP VP -- and , ADVP , NP VP ; NP VP -- IN S . but EX VBD NP .
CC SBAR , NP VP , and NP ADVP VP .
and NP NP .
from RB i started IN NP .
2005 i did a base jump IN NP , IN NP and IN NP in NNP .
PRP VBP NP PP , but WRB VBP NP VP ?
and VBP SBAR , &quot; NP , INTJ NP VP . &quot;
i think NP VP .
is NN IN NP ?
so DT NN IN NP will VB NP .
and &quot; ha - ha , there is DT NN and RB VBZ NP and WP VBZ NP VP ? &quot;
in the spec@@ tac@@ ular large - scale projects he &apos;s famous for , ol@@ af@@ ur eli@@ as@@ son creates NN IN NP . this idea - packed talk begins with an experiment in NP PP .
i think that NP VP .
we need a NP HYPH JJ organization for NN NN , because NP VP .
when she was 10 years old in 19@@ 27 , she published her first book of NP VP &quot; NP VP . &quot;
and my blood fro@@ ze when i read that because NP VP .
nat@@ al@@ ie mer@@ ch@@ ant s@@ ings IN NP , NP VP . & NN ; / NP : NP IN NP .
they are very different IN NP in NN NN .
so as an adult , when i started to read about the amazing break@@ through@@ s with pen@@ ny patter@@ son and ko@@ ko , with VP and NP , NP , NP , NP NP , i got all excited .
NP VP and NP VP .
VP are NP : NP , NP , CC NP .
that &apos;s a number only that NP VP .
what that means is that what we &apos;re learning with NP PP will teach us , ultimately , how we might interact IN NP IN NP .
all right , well thank PRP NP PP .
and RB NP PP VBP VP .
PRP VBP NP . WP ?
and NP , NP .
remember IN NP ?
and NP VP , and NP VP .
as NP VP , a project evol@@ ves IN NP .
but then we had DT NN IN NP , &quot; INTJ , NP VP . &apos; &quot; so , appar@@ ently this is WRB NP VP .
china symbo@@ li@@ zed IN NP .
you can VB NP .
if NP VP , you will RB VB NP PP .
so if you go back into the par@@ king , into the cor@@ ri@@ d@@ ors , it &apos;s almost like travel@@ ing into a par@@ alle@@ l universe from cars and colors , into NP PP - NP NP .
and our main idea was to sort IN NP NP PP and rein@@ ter@@ pre@@ t PRP IN NP , JJ PP .
CC NP VP , before NP VP , i should VB NP S .
because NP VP solve NNS .
so what i &apos;m pro@@ pos@@ ing is really to say that NP VP , for a very long time , had a situation when we &apos;ve had a men@@ u of NNS .
and ADVP NP VP , FRAG ?
but it &apos;s saying that what we can do IN NP is very little , at a very high cost .
the inci@@ dence of NN is about NP VP .
so again , WP NP VP is NN CONJP NN , IN NP .
of course , that &apos;s RB because NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
over the past hundred years , the combin@@ ation of liber@@ al democracy and private capit@@ alism has helped to cat@@ ap@@ ult NP CC NP IN NP .
i put it to you today that it is this system that is em@@ bo@@ died by china that is gather@@ ing NN IN NP in NP PP TO VP , because NP VP .
i &apos;m here to also tell you that NP VP .
but NP VP , and PP , NP VP .
in DT NN , we can VB NP .
that SBAR , NP VP .
and so even if we make NP PP , it rema@@ ins statisti@@ cally true that NP VP and NP VP and NP VP .
and i of course knew NN , IN NP , IN NP , RB IN S .
after about three days , the bub@@ bles will appear on NP PP .
and VP , VP .
NP , NP , WHNP S is not JJ .
ba@@ o y@@ on@@ g@@ xi@@ u : &quot; NP VP , but if NP VP in a rus@@ h . &quot;
many artic@@ les calcu@@ late : how long would it take IN NP VP ?
another time , after NP VP , her yo@@ unger sister came VP , VP .
VBP NP .
IN NP , EX VBD NP .
step two : they teach the children the kor@@ an , which is islam &apos;s NP , PP , NP VP and can not speak .
this boy is VBN NP .
we &apos;ve flo@@ wn the cas@@ sin@@ i spac@@ ec@@ raft by this moon now several times , flying closer and deeper IN NP , IN NP , so that RB PRP VBP VP .
we &apos;re always sort of small in NP PP .
and DT NN VBZ NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
VBP NP .
and this material that &apos;s de@@ pos@@ ited either starts as NP CC NP .
the detail WDT NP VP is quite amazing .
but it &apos;s very hard to create that IN NP .
you can just make PRP RB IN NP .
NP VP , PRP VBP S .
NNS VBP NP .
but it wasn NP ADVP NP . RB in DT JJ NN , PRP$ NN IN NP began VP .
what does that mean IN NP IN NP ?
but that &apos;s still not reason for NP VP .
al ja@@ ze@@ era VBD NP PP , VBD NP SBAR , VBD NP , and VBD NP , VBD NP NP .
VBP NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
NP VP , and PP , NP VP .
i truly believe NP VP .
by the way , the secret is not to go to NN until NP VP .
i had just taken tri@@ gon@@ ome@@ try in high school , NP VP and WRB NP VP .
i &apos;m gla@@ d NP VP , bat@@ ter@@ ies are un@@ belie@@ v@@ ably energy -- lack of NP PP .
NP VP , NP VP , NP VP and NP VP .
so what you see here is 12 separate pe@@ t@@ als , that each could be controlled IN NP .
so , once PRP VBP NP , now you &apos;re VBG NP because NP VP .
NP VP but ADVP NP VP .
RB RB PRP VBD NP ADVP .
ADVP NP VP and NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
bill gro@@ ss : a solar energy system that VBZ NP
but still , we look IN NP .
and out IN NP we &apos;ll RB VB NP PP .
and that was a good thing to help , NP VP , the cause .
RB , NP VP , and ADVP NP VP .
i work IN NP , and PRP VBP NP , and NP VP and NP VP .
and &quot; would &quot; SINV , NP VP , and NP VP .
and then , we don NP VP , but we do VB NP , and i vis@@ ited PRP IN NP IN NP , IN NP .
PRP VBD NP PP and NP VP and NP VP and NP VP .
so -- and NP VP WRB NP VP , we &apos;re IN NP .
FW FW : DT VBN NN
but ne@@ ver@@ th@@ eless , there &apos;s DT JJ NN IN NP IN NP , IN NP .
so , as NP VP , DT IN NP &apos;s RB NN .
they &apos;ll be cooking , cle@@ an@@ ing , buying NP , NP , NP . but they aren &apos; t here .
NP VP , but ADVP NP VP .
kat@@ r@@ ina showed us that we can not completely dep@@ end IN NP VP , to be capable IN S .
for example , all mas@@ ks are made IN NP .
add IN NP , you &apos;re in JJ NN .
let NP VP , should we order that NP VP ?
in the s@@ ars epidemic , we learned in h@@ ong kon@@ g that most of NN was because NP VP .
DT NML NN VBD NP .
the institute of NN NN felt that NP VP .
clearly the bottom line is NP ADVP VP .
in terms of where we are in NN IN NP and so on , it &apos;s not that far off .
we &apos;ve never seen anything RB RB IN NP before . &quot;
it &apos;s really man@@ eu@@ ver@@ able . you have a hand - held remote , so NP VP , bra@@ king , go in rever@@ se if you like , also have bra@@ king .
INTJ , NP VP , PRP VBD NP .
but IN NP PRP VBP S . WP VBP NP ?
NP VP -- CONJP NP .
DT NN IN NP dis@@ sol@@ ves IN NP .
NP VP , right ?
i make NP VP .
i want you just for a second to VB NP .
and WDT NP VP is VP . &quot;
we &apos;ve done stri@@ pping experiments where we &apos;ve re@@ moved NP PP and looked at NP PP .
NP VP ; NP VP ; NP VP .
NP VP , NP VP , NP VP .
i brought NP CC NP IN NP .
once IN NP , the world was DT JJ , JJ NN .
so we are moving IN NP , and i &apos;ve been IN NP IN NP .
so that NP VP .
skep@@ tic@@ ism , because NP VP .
they &apos;re watching DT IN NP . they &apos;ve VBD NP , and they &apos;ve built DT NN NN VP , and if NP PP VBP PP , we &apos;re ar@@ re@@ sted IN NP .
now , when you think of a coral re@@ e@@ f , this is what most people think of : NP CC NP .
over time , those gas molecules dis@@ solve IN NP and start VP .
and this ri@@ g was actually used IN NP .
now , as NP VP , we produce NP , CC SBAR .
and i can talk about it all day -- just ask my wife -- but i want to move IN IN NP .
we also see NP , ADJP ADVP IN S .
ADVP , NP VP -- NP VP .
RB , DT NN VBZ ADJP .
DT NN NP VP -- but NP ADVP VP .
despite the fact that NP VP , most of these dis@@ orders are diagno@@ sed sol@@ ely on NP PP .
research shows that 50 percent of NP , NP are actually suffering IN NP .
they don NP VP , IN S .
richard sau@@ l wur@@ man : i remember hearing NP VP .
NNS NN , UH !
NP VP , but PP PRN NP VP .
WP if NP VP ?
WRB VP NP ?
NP SBAR , NP VP VB NP SBAR .
ADVP NP VP , but NP VP .
so , if NP ADJP , why did we only capture four out IN NP ?
come IN NP IN NP .
but under DT NN S , this dri@@ ll , like DT NN NN , pl@@ ung@@ es NP JJ IN NP TO VP .
don &apos; t we already know NP PP ?
NP VP , or NP VP .
and NP PP VBZ NP .
it &apos;s finan@@ ce@@ able IN NP .
this is not very gra@@ ti@@ fying IN NP .
each one is formed IN NP , instead IN NP .
for example , fe@@ e - bates , DT NN IN NP , can VB NP and cor@@ respon@@ d@@ ingly pay NP NP .
and make DT NN IN NP go faster .
RB NP NP IN NP .
we launched NP VP what will i be like WRB NP VP ? &quot;
girl 6 : like , if NP VP and NP VP , you would think IN S games were kin@@ da s@@ is@@ sy .
b@@ l : i &apos;m going to fast - forward to the decision point because i know i don NP VP .
bren@@ da lau@@ re@@ l : NNS IN NP
i also need al@@ co@@ hol and mor@@ ph@@ ine , because NP VP . &quot;
many soci@@ ologists like ve@@ bl@@ en and wol@@ fe would argue that NP VP .
there are now do@@ zens , perhaps hundreds of NP VP .
people have mur@@ dered those that they loved , belie@@ ving that NP VP .
then we asked them , &quot; how much would you pay IN NP swe@@ ater ? &quot;
they just don JJ NN IN NP .
as many of you know , this is the com@@ position where the pian@@ ist si@@ ts at a ben@@ ch , op@@ ens up the piano and si@@ ts and does nothing for NP CC NP -- that period of sil@@ ence .
NN NN : NP PP
so what i &apos;m going VP you is all of NP , NP -- NN - based medicine .
&quot; DT NN IN NP a day could help VB NP . &quot;
and the cla@@ im was fish oil p@@ ills improve NP PP .
CD NN p@@ ills a day be@@ ats NP NP .
ADVP , NP , RB NP , but ADVP PP .
so you can see here that NP VP .
we already have NP VP .
and pretty soon , they began VP , NN IN NP , NN NN IN NP , NN IN NP , RB IN NP and RB IN NP .
can you imagine what you would feel if NP VP ?
NP VP ; NP VP .
ADVP NP , and NP VP .
and WP VBP NP VP ? PRP VBP NP .
and this word here , george bush called NP NP .
you &apos;ve got to see NP : NP .
of course , you got NP ADJP .
and what i want NP VP is picture her as NP VP .
can you feel NP , NP , NP IN SBAR ?
and suddenly , without VBG NP , you &apos;re VBG NP ADVP .
communication walls , i don NP VP -- the internet -- have come tu@@ m@@ bling down .
more than RB before NP VP .
and that means an increase in@@ cen@@ tive to VB NP .
i think of NP , NP .
JJ NN : NP PP .
WRB NP VP oil was NP PP .
if NP VP , RB DT NN alone , on DT NN -- WDT NP VP -- DT NN IN NP IN NP would RB VB PP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
what will we find as NP VP ?
human - forced climate change alone -- again , if un@@ ab@@ ated -- could elimin@@ ate NP PP .
it makes NP PP JJ PP , on NN , anywhere IN NP .
UH , JJ NN VBD .
NN , NN , NN .
there NP NP WHNP S .
al@@ ber@@ to worked IN NP .
well birds are pretty hard - wired , as it happens , ADVP NP VP , but S , NP VP and how to find PRP$ NN IN NP .
another interesting project , though NP VP , is the northern white r@@ hin@@ o@@ cer@@ os .
there &apos;s going to VB NP .
he ran and worked IN NP .
and i liked making DT NN because NP VP , and NP VP .
NP VP -- and NP VP .
PRP RB VBD NP .
NP VP and NP VP .
mr@@ s. al@@ isch cut in NP PP said , &quot; NP VP . &quot;
i said , VB NP , how are you ? &quot;
when i was vis@@ iting my ter@@ min@@ ally ill father in a hospital , i was asking myself , how does anybody get well in a place that sounds IN NP ?
this is affected massi@@ vely by NN time , WRB NP VP .
what does it cost to treat a classroom down IN NP ?
PRP VBP NP .
in &quot; up@@ wake &quot; buildings wear NP VP .
but the teachers came to me after@@ ward and told me they hadn NP VP .
PRP VBZ NP .
IN NP NP ADVP RB VB NP .
and in NP CC NP , like NP , NP , there &apos;s NN VP .
and can PRP VB NP NP ? &quot;
NNP NNP , NP PP , NP PP , IN NP IN NP .
tell a kid NP VP , they &apos;re in sho@@ ck .
i have NP , NP , CC NP . &quot;
will PRP VB NP ? RB RB not .
ADVP , NP VP : ADVP , NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
you can think IN NP . &quot;
now , i &apos;m sure NP VP . &quot;
IN NP , NP PP VP , CC S . &quot;
so you get NP PP .
i tend TO VP , because NP VP .
so we have NP , NP , CC NP .
UH , and NP , CONJP NP VBZ NP : S .
WP NP VP is NP PP .
WRB VBP NP VP ? VP , VP ! ... NN ? NP NP VBZ SBAR . NP : NP : / NP CC NP :
this is VP , VP CC VP .
learning about DT JJ NN is one thing ; learning IN NP -- that VBZ NP .
life can &apos; NP VP . how does life make NNS ?
imagine making all of NP NP .
power of shape : here &apos;s a wh@@ ale . we &apos;ve seen that NP VP . and those little bu@@ mp@@ s actually increase NP PP -- increase NN IN NP .
and we use all of NP , RB NP .
ok , so that VBZ NP .
and IN NP , NP PP VBZ NP .
WRB VBP NP ADJP ? &quot;
NP VP , but NP VP .
PRP VBP SBAR ?
and when i was appl@@ ying to NN NN and felt certain i couldn &apos; t do it and nobody NP VP had done NP , NP VP .
but it was NP JJ .
but the way WDT VP has always evolved IN NP .
and now all be@@ ts are RB .
and yet , all the press is focused IN NP .
NP IN , NP VP , and S , CC S .
and IN NP .
so , it turns out NP VP .
IN NP , DT VBZ NP .
so , WRB NP VP , we move IN IN NP .
i think that NP VP .
so DT NN IN NP took NP , NP , and PRP VBD ADVP NP , and NP VP and NP VP .
as NP VP , only half the states have VBN PP .
DT NN VBZ NP , and SBAR , NP VP and NP VP .
if PRP VBP NP , our media climate generally provi@@ des a RB JJ mirror IN NP and IN NP , and i think that NP VP .
WRB NP VP -- and NP VP -- they have NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
RB VBZ NP NP , NP , VP ! &quot;
NP VP , and NP VP .
okay . now on the left you can see the hand -- that &apos;s NP : CC NP . the hand ho@@ vering .
and i said , S , MD NP VP ? &quot;
NP ADVP VP -- NP VP .
doctors back then were rou@@ tin@@ ely telling men the importance of NP NP .
british sex@@ ologist ro@@ y le@@ v@@ in has spe@@ cul@@ ated that NP VP .
and i said , &quot; so why VP you just stimu@@ late NP PP ?
and the woman would have NN IN NP .
and yet , despite everything going really well for NNP , he was strug@@ gling , fighting NP CC NP .
now i know that VP .
VB NP .
and it seemed IN NP even he felt really bad VBG NP day after day .
we are only happy when things are IN NP .
so we can also see DT RB RB IN NP .
and i think NP VP .
but IN NP , PRP VP CC VP .
and i started to bring DT NN IN NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
and mom@@ s gra@@ b their kids out IN NP and say , NP VP ! &quot;
NP VP ; NP VP .
it &apos;s as though NP VP .
IN NP , RB DT VBZ NP .
they were trying to answer the question of what would human beings do now that NP VP ?
NP VP ; NP VP .
this is what we must demand of NP , PP , IN NP , IN NP : living with in@@ tent .
i didn NP VP , but i knew NP , NP , and i knew IN S .
but NP VP , and S , CC S .
VP NP PP PRN NP PP ?
and as NP VP , a woman approach@@ ed IN NP .
no , i was quie@@ t . i was quie@@ t because NP VP .
NP NP NP VP . &quot;
UH , NN .
PRP VBD NP . PRP VBD NP .
and it sees JJ NNS IN NP , remem@@ bers WHADVP S , and looks IN NP IN NP , VP .
NP VP , but NP VP . could PRP VB ADVP ? &quot;
and i did NP PP .
for example , dan p@@ ink &apos;s talk on motivation , which was pretty good if NP NP : &quot; drop car@@ rot . drop stick . bring meaning . &quot;
they used their six words to talk back to PRP and ask me if NP VP .
and i would only pay $ 9@@ 9@@ .@@ 50 -- so stay even below NP PP .
okay , part one starts back in 19@@ 29 when the great astronom@@ er ed@@ win hu@@ b@@ ble realized that NP VP .
expres@@ sed IN NP , it is spec@@ tac@@ ul@@ arly small .
RB NP , NP , CC NP MD VP .
and in NP SBAR they collapse RB IN NP ADVP SBAR .
because NP VP .
you see , we learned that NP VP .
NP VP and ADVP , NP VP and NP VP .
you &apos;re going to meet NN IN NP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
NN : NP VP .
now , TO VP , we needed NP VP .
PRP VBD PRT NP .
and suddenly she sees NP VP .
i believe NP ADVP VP .
and that &apos;s pretty much WRB NP VP .
and all NP VP is VP .
and that &apos;s RB WP NP VP .
RB RB RB CD NNS .
as fast as NP VP , the brain activity shif@@ ts TO VP , as if NP ADVP VP .
and NP VP , and NP ADVP VP ; PP , NP VP -- but ADVP VP . &quot;
why would we waste DT NN IN NP ? &quot;
and that brings PRP IN NP IN NP . &quot;
in NNP , in NP PP , from NP PP , boy and girl babies basically survive IN NP IN S , and the breast shows DT NN NN .
so what would some IN NP VBP PP ?
ADVP NP VP ; NP VP .
well , when she had her second daughter , her mother in - law told her son , &quot; i think NP VP .
the tw@@ ins started VBG NP .
NP ADVP VP , and NP VP .
s@@ her@@ y@@ l wu@@ dun@@ n &apos;s NN RB S . her stories sho@@ ck . only WRB NP VP will we be VBG NP .
why not ? i mean , that &apos;s WP NP VP .
and this cu@@ mu@@ la@@ tive cultural adap@@ tation , as NP VP , is responsible IN NP .
the other option we could choose was to develop the systems of communication that would allow NP VP .
and this is why our species has pro@@ sper@@ ed around the world while DT NN IN NP sit IN NP .
and this is also true IN NP .
VP , NN VBZ NP .
biolog@@ ist mark pa@@ gel shares an intri@@ gu@@ ing theory about why humans evolved our complex system of language . he suggests that language is a piece of &quot; social technology &quot; that allowed early human tri@@ bes to access NP : NP .
and what i &apos;m most interested in is the invisible space between a text and its ac@@ compan@@ ying image , and how the image is trans@@ formed IN NP IN NP .
this is the only fe@@ der@@ ally fund@@ ed site where it is legal to cul@@ tiv@@ ate NN IN NP .
DT VBZ NP .
IN NP , NP PP VBD NP .
he ended up ser@@ ving NP PP IN NP .
last year alone , 99 fe@@ der@@ ally dec@@ lar@@ ed dis@@ ast@@ ers were on NP PP , from NP , NP , to NP SBAR .
so the first idea NP VP , ini@@ tially , was just TO VP . &quot;
our school would show NN IN NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
there &apos;s NP VP .
so given that NP VP , how good are we at increasing PRP$ NN ?
we also find that NP VP .
so WRB NP VP , they tend VP NP , SBAR .
it wouldn NP VP . it wouldn &apos; t sleep . it wouldn NP VP .
and even NNS IN NP WDT NP VP .
PRP VBP NP PP , and NP VP , and NP VP .
i end IN NP .
why would PRP VB NP ?
ADVP NP VP , and ADVP NP VP .
it means that , if PRP VBP NP , you have more chance that NP VP .
and by RB VBG NP ADVP , we were able VP .
and this is RB NP PP .
now , what is NP PP ?
in JJ NNS , if NP VP , my hand , NN IN NP .
it emer@@ ges IN NP .
so , that &apos;s 20 micro@@ meters across , that NP ADVP .
this is a be@@ e &apos;s leg with NP VP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
it &apos;s certainly what i learned WRB NP VP .
PRP VBP NP ADVP .
and she started , NP NP .
DT NNS VBP NP , but NP VP , SBAR , NP VP , NP VP .
now what are NP PP ?
and DT JJ JJ NNS VBP NP .
we still have two to NP VP .
RB if NP VP , we have NP PP .
we copy DT IN NP by VP .
and in the case of NP PP , these cells may not even be human .
but there &apos;s also a scientific reason that dro@@ ve this project , which was to use this natural lon@@ git@@ u@@ din@@ al data to understand the process of how a child lear@@ ns NN -- NP VP .
the way TO VP is , on NP VP .
ADVP NP VP , NP VP , and NP VP .
this has become NP PP .
and there are , again , now tens of millions of these links that give PRP NP PP and how they rel@@ ate IN NP .
and then i went on VP , NP , NP , i &apos;m going VP &quot; -- who VBD NP you can now ? &quot;
mit resear@@ cher NP VP &apos;s NN , then par@@ sed NP PP VP . &quot; ast@@ on@@ ishing , data - rich research with NP PP .
DT JJ NN IN NP is VBN NP .
we make meaning by seeing , IN NP .
secon@@ dly , making NP ADJP .
NP VP , and NP ADVP VP .
but PRP VBP NP , and ADVP NP ADVP VP , and ADVP NP VP .
but you &apos;ve RB VBN NP ADVP .
and in there he said that NP VP .
QP IN NP NN , NP FRAG . &quot; &quot; o@@ ops &quot; DT . &quot; o@@ ops , war@@ ped . &quot;
the problem is NP VP .
all we have VP is look at WDT NP VP .
DT VBZ CC VBZ NP .
that is , NP VP .
in DT ADJP NN , buil@@ der dan phil@@ li@@ ps NP NP IN NP S . brilliant , JJ HYPH NN design details will VB NP . CC NN ; NP CC NP ; / PRP & NN ;
and the reason NP VP is IN S .
there is no more dra@@ stic and sudden gap created between NP CC NP than DT JJ NN NN .
but if you look into DT NN IN NP , that single eye NP VP , i &apos;m looking down , but let me tell you WRB NP VP .
NP VP , but PP , NP VP .
NP VP , and PP , NP VP .
VP -- NP VP .
ADVP NP VP and NP VP .
and so i was sitting IN NP , VP ...
and if NP VP , if NP VP , it dete@@ cts WHNP S .
and i started in NP , NP . but when PRP VBP NP , you get DT JJ nervous . i thought , DT NNS VBG PP actually have NP SBAR , i thought , maybe they know NP SBAR . so i did a pre-@@ test WRB NP VP .
now what has happened IN NP ? we want to VB NP .
where are DT JJ NNS ? i can VB NP NP .
NNS , JJ NN . JJ JJ NN , NP SBAR .
NP PP VBZ PP . and PRP MD VP . NP VP , and NP VP . PRP MD VP .
CC NP VP , hu@@ h ?
but PRP RB VBZ NP .
so i had DT ADJP NN IN NP .
and ADVP , NP VP , so NP VP . and PRP VBD , SBAR .
CC NP VP , and NP VP -- PRP VBD NP .
and we knew NP VP .
but that &apos;s DT RB -- INTJ , NP VP .
so , we started with breast cancer because there &apos;s lots of NP , NP .
VP , and NP VP ?
you need to know that NP VP and takes 18 months when you win .
now what did i learn IN NP ? well , three things .
UH , NN NN IN NP .
PRP VBD NP .
they laugh@@ ed RB .
ADVP NP VP , PP , NP VP , NP VP .
NP . NNP , NNP VBZ ADVP VP .
so WP NP VP is DT JJ NN .
NP VP , and NP VP -- NP VP ; NP VP .
IN NP , NP SBAR VBD NP , PP .
he lives IN NP ADVP IN NP .
and NP VP , and PP , NP VP .
it &apos;s JJ S , IN NP .
and is it easy VP ?
and she VBD NP PP and VP : NP .
NP VP , and ADVP NP VP .
b@@ j : so , as NP VP -- extreme temper@@ atures , VB NP PP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
but NP VP -- NP ADVP VP ? &quot;
and that &apos;s probably because we haven &apos; t seen it like NP VP .
my ti@@ tle : &quot; que@@ erer than NP VP : the stran@@ gen@@ ess of science . &quot;
NP VP , NP , PP , VBP ADVP ADVP VP .
if we &apos;d evolved IN NP , we would expect them to VB NP ADVP . if we were NP , VP , it would be different , but we middle worl@@ ders are too big TO VP .
WP NP VP is not NP CC NP .
mira@@ cles are RB NP SBAR .
we &apos;d be JJ , our characters would be different , if NP VP .
i went IN NP and gradu@@ ated IN NP , VBG S .
all of us have dis@@ abilities in NP CC NP .
can you show us how good IN NP PRP VBP ?
moving on IN NP , the next person to VB NP was a gentle@@ man called NP PP .
then on DT NN we can VB NP .
NP VP and , SBAR , NP VP .
and PRP VBZ ADJP .
and you don &apos; t necessarily have the sense that twitter is in NP NP .
it &apos;s NP PP .
NP VP , and NP ADVP VP .
WRB NP VP , you look IN NP .
nor do i think we are IN NP , actually going VP .
there &apos;s DT NN right RB in NP VP .
RB RB VBZ NP VP , NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
we have to VB NP .
IN NP , IN NP , NP NP RB VBD NP . PRP VBP VP . and WP VBP NP VP ?
it &apos;s not that NP VP .
NP VP , VBZ NP NN . NP VP ; ADVP , NP VP . IN NP , JJ VBZ NP PP .
the short answer is , ADVP , NP VP .
this is a bil@@ l@@ board WDT VP : &quot; wel@@ come to NP PP . &quot;
let NP VP .
IN NP , EX VBZ NP .
so , like , ok , maybe it had to VB PP -- you know , like , NP VP , or , NP VP .
so NP , NP CC NP VBP NP .
finally , in about the six@@ te@@ ent@@ h century , a physi@@ cian whose name was NP NP , VBN NP : : NP found that he could predict NP PP IN S .
NP VP , NP VP , and NP VP .
NP VP , DT NN MD VP .
and they tried everything NP VP .
well , he said , &quot; can &apos; t NP VP ? &quot;
and things got better and better , and within three or four months , i was dis@@ char@@ ged from that hospital , and i jo@@ ined a group of surge@@ ons where i could work IN NP , not IN NP , but fairly close by .
so one of the reasons that i have come here to talk IN NP is to -- frank@@ ly , sel@@ fis@@ h@@ ly -- un@@ bur@@ den myself and let it be known that NP VP has written all of these books .
i believe NP VP .
now , what is remarkable is that civil rights in NN were achie@@ ved IN NP .
but i think NP VP .
and we have had NP SBAR .
NP VP , S CC S , NP VP .
and then DT NN NN IN NP &quot; WHADVP SQ . &quot;
so the question is , how do you rein@@ vent NP SBAR ?
and the most remarkable fe@@ at is that NP ADVP VP .
and you see here DT NN IN NP .
some of NP PP often happen at NP PP .
if NP VP , you can VB NP .
data : DT NN IN NP are RB IN NP .
so this is actually the first time NP VP .
what can we do together that NP NP ?
stran@@ gen@@ ess is that NP VP .
it all began for him during world war ii , when at age 17 he found NP VP .
i was born IN NP .
so IN NP my father had VP .
but PRP VBD ADVP NP .
he also expla@@ ined to me that PRP VBD NP , ADVP , and the first time i saw them NP VP , and they were NP JJR IN NP .
NN VBD RB VP .
NP VP , PRP VBZ ADVP NP .
never have we seen , in NP , NP .
as a si@@ del@@ ine , you know that NP VP .
WP NP VP is NP , NP , SBAR .
under NP PP , NP , NP CC NP IN S .
the key though in NP PP is NP PP , moving away from a situation where PRP RB VBP VP , where NP ADVP VP , and NP VP , &quot; WP VP ?
though NP VP , NP VP , DT NN S right now is IN S .
but NP VP ; NP VP .
VB NP . &quot;
DT VBZ ADJP PP . NP NP , NP PP .
they do NP PP , they will come RP IN NP .
a han@@ ger .
and we can then see the result of such mu@@ tations when we compare NP PP RB IN NP , for example .
and later , between 100 and 5@@ 0,000 years ago or so , went out of africa to col@@ oni@@ ze DT NN IN NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
statisti@@ cally speaking , there is no difference in how often NP NP CC NP .
NP VP , and ADVP , NP VP .
so sustain@@ ability is quite important IN NP .
so let NP VP .
we have NP PP .
DT VBP NP .
DT VBZ NP . PRP VBZ RB NP . NP ADVP VP , and NP VP .
there are NNS IN NP all IN NP .
UH , NP VP , so NP VP . PRP VBD S .
it &apos;s almost as if NP , you &apos;re not VBG NP PP .
early NN IN NP can VB NP , but DT JJ NN IN NP make NP ADJP . at tedx@@ pe@@ ach@@ tree , ami kli@@ n descri@@ bes NP VP . & lt ; NP CC NP : & NN ; / em & gt ;
if NP VP , now you stand RP .
you are going to VB NP .
NP VP : NP , NP .
more importantly , the force WDT NP VP was spread IN NP .
i asked , &quot; where were PRP IN NP ? &quot;
i learned NP VP .
and if you &apos;re a leader , the people who count IN NP need you on your feet .
she then as@@ sig@@ ned these NP VP : NP , NP ; NP , NP .
what that might mean IN NP RB PP , the &quot; NP , NP VP seems incredibly pres@@ cient totally important .
so , what do i discover when i look IN NP ?
they down@@ lo@@ aded it from NP , CC NP , 14 days after VP .
DT VBZ NP .
i called IN NP .
but CD NN VBZ RB NP .
PRP VBD NP NP .
you can &apos; NP VP .
they typ@@ ed PRP IN NP , transl@@ ated PRP IN NP , went RB IN NP .
GW NP re@@ x NP GW NP : VBP NP . VBP NP ADVP .
DT JJ NN , ADVP SBAR , NP PP VP , VP , VP .
i love NP PP .
NN : NP VP . IN NP , PRP VBD NP .
and as she was there on the edge of NP , NP NP VP , and NP VP , but before PRP VBD , the audience saw the black - clad sta@@ ge@@ hands .
what the hell are we doing RB RB IN NP ?
j@@ ul@@ ie ta@@ y@@ mor : NP , NP and NP PP
you choose . it &apos;s NP , NP . &quot;
and so , on a mi@@ cr@@ o level , there &apos;s a real role for DT NN IN NP .
and i really understood what patient capital meant emotion@@ ally in the last month or so . because the company was literally 10 days away from pro@@ ving that the product NP VP was at NP VP , when they were in the biggest c@@ ash crisis of their history .
in our first year , the first net went off the line in NP PP .
she was RB RB IN NP sitting IN NP .
now , when we first started talking IN NP -- the name of the song is &quot; NP ADVP VP -- we were really excited because they expres@@ sed interest in VP .
the machine itself would VB NP .
it doesn &apos; t matter what temperature it is , NP NP .
and now to VB NP , we have ok go .
and so we built some very sophisti@@ cated radio anten@@ n@@ as just for prob@@ ing DT NNS and se@@ arch@@ ing IN NP .
so we thought of NP VP . let NP VP , any of PRP could be VBG , PP .
and the later NP VP , the worse the consequences .
NP VP , and NP ADVP VP .
i &apos;ve tried to show IN NP that WP NP VP is NP SBAR . you tend to be interested IN NP . and in that 50 years , if you look at DT NN NN , you find DT NN IN NP more than dou@@ bles and we &apos;re up three - and - a-half times since i was born . when you have a new baby , by NP SBAR more people will be ad@@ ded than VBD PP SBAR .
your great - great grand@@ parents got by IN NP , and yet we all think NP VP . and with all the wonderful technology we have we can VB NP .
it &apos;s NN IN NP .
all right .
well , inspired IN NP , i decided TO VP .
VBP NP .
&quot; NP VP ? &quot;
over NP PP , he pro@@ ved DT IN NP .
he pro@@ ved it was NP PP more than NP , NP , NP CC NP .
it took PRP , IN NP , VBP NP . &quot;
it &apos;s because of cur@@ tis co@@ op@@ er that NP VP , currently the largest prime number NP VP , is 2 ^ 5@@ 7@@ ,@@ 8@@ 8@@ 5@@ ,@@ 16@@ 1 .
we live in an age where some of the great break@@ through@@ s are not going to happen in NP CC NP but IN NP , IN NP .
and what was so gor@@ ge@@ ous about NP VP and NP VP ?
in fact , growing RP IN NP , it always was incredibly exciting WRB NP VP .
scientists around the world were intri@@ gu@@ ed by NP , NP , that was spre@@ ading through the tas@@ mani@@ an de@@ vil population .
he &apos;s a tas@@ mani@@ an de@@ vil that we found IN NP IN NP .
he &apos;s a dog that bel@@ on@@ gs IN NP .
RB , IN NP , PRP MD VP .
so if we &apos;re married , we &apos;re more likely to VB NP .
so JJS IN NP put PRP IN NP IN NP .
number two : re@@ gar@@ d@@ less IN NP , DT JJ NN IN NP makes NP ADJP .
so they tend to expect the future to be worse than NP VP .
but if NN VBD PRT S , &quot; NP VP and NP VP , &quot; UH , bad news .
and what he &apos;s doing is he &apos;s pas@@ sing a small magnetic pul@@ se through the sk@@ ul@@ l of NP PP into their in@@ fer@@ ior fron@@ tal gy@@ rus .
and i believe NP VP .
it really should be called NP PP .
but think of what it does to how we think IN NP .
NP PP VBD VP .
you know , it looks at NP VP .
and as NP VP , china has not VBN NP .
now i don NP VP .
in fact , they &apos;ve accoun@@ ted for NN IN NP .
and WRB VBZ NP ADJP ADVP ?
so the don@@ ors have to stick IN NP .
and indeed , unfortunately , if you navi@@ gate IN NP you get a very un@@ focused agenda , because PP , NP VP , but NP VP .
there &apos;s one sector which isn NP VP , and which can VB NP , and which is , IN NP , DT JJ NN S , post-@@ conflict , and that is the construction sector .
the planning function and policy function sta@@ ys with NP : NP , you should use WHNP S -- NP , NP , NP .
what VBZ NP ?
NP VP , and NP VP .
PRP VBP NP PP .
it makes NN , NN ? RB NP NP , the planes can VP CC VP .
EX VBP NP .
NP NP ...
NNP : ADVP NP ADJP ?
now this has raised NP PP .
and he asked that NP VP ?
they weren &apos; t willing to engage IN NP .
UH , IN NP , NP PP VBD NP .
ADVP IN NP , PP , NP VP , and NP VP .
you have VP , you couldn NP VP .
NP VP , and ADVP NP VP , NP VP , NP VP , and SBAR , NP VP .
NP VP , and NP ADVP VP .
NP VP , but NP VP , and so DT VBZ SBAR .
it &apos;s a story that &apos;s DT NN IN NP .
and so that NN IN NP continu@@ es IN NP .
NP VP , NP VP , and ADVP NP VP .
UH , NP VP , and NP VP .
this is the world peace game . what is wrong IN NP ? &quot;
&quot; let NP VP .
this is about NP NP .
he r@@ ings the bell again . he says , &quot; NP VP , NP , VP .
in india , we had NP , NP un@@ clear &#93; movement .
WRB NP VP , you use NP PP .
PRP RB VBP NP .
now this is NP SBAR .
but this is NP PP .
i just put DT IN NP .
they are f@@ used together , so NP VP .
EX VBP NP . NN MD VP .
this is called &quot; NP VP . &quot;
and NP VP , and NP VP .
so i &apos;m going to talk IN NP .
the way we tend VP is we extra@@ ct NP , NP VP and then dis@@ pose IN NP .
and NP VP , and NP VP .
so amazing example of an adap@@ tation to a very resource - constrained environment -- and in that sense , very relevant to the kind of challenges we &apos;re going to be facing over NP , NP .
so this is WRB NP VP .
NP VP ; NP VP .
and if i want to VB S i &apos;m 35 , that meant that NP VP .
RB , EX VBD NP .
and they say IN NP , VP . &quot;
for me , the ho@@ b@@ bi@@ es WDT NP VP are really just new work projects WDT NP VP .
she said NP VP . &quot;
remember , i &apos;m somebody who said that NP VP and NP VP and NP VP .
obviously , i &apos;m VBG NP ?
i know NP VP .
imagine NP VP . that makes NP PP .
but a few kids are sad and blue because NP VP .
DT VBZ NP .
so let NP VP .
NN NN : NP PP
PRP VBP NP S .
well , this has deep impli@@ cations about NP PP , about NP PP , about NP PP , about NP PP and about VP .
so let NP VP .
so , i &apos;m RB JJ IN NP DT .
then , the idea is that NP VP .
but in ADVP DT JJ NN IN NP , one can think IN NP IN S .
that was JJ .
NP VP and , ADVP , NP VP .
and this is only done in NP , NP than NP PP , at NP SBAR .
NP VP , and NP ADVP VP .
well , my dream of VP will not come VP .
NP VP , PRP$ NN VBD NP .
this should have VBN VP . we can &apos; NP VP . &quot;
i learned that NP VP .
and yes , she was older to be IN NP .
and we will live IN NP . thank you very much .
it took us 50 years to reach NP PP . 50 years .
so we &apos;re starting to pay for NP PP WDT NP VP .
we &apos;re going to go IN NP .
NP PP VBZ NP .
but they also talk about the fact that their ex@@ ecu@@ tives , DT IN NP are put IN NP IN NP VP .
DT JJ NN VBZ NP .
the traditional thing would be VP ?
it &apos;s been RB JJ IN NP .
i know a woman who &apos;s good IN NP .
go RB IN NP -- what does he need ?
in fact , i grew up obser@@ ving NP PP .
NP VP , and ADVP NP VP .
i ski@@ pped school often and dre@@ am@@ ed of becoming DT NN IN NP .
IN NP , IN NP NN , NNP VBZ NP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
but there were times when i wanted to re@@ mind both sides that NP VP .
books have saved the intro@@ ver@@ ted , ti@@ mi@@ d child WDT NP VP -- that NP ADVP VP .
au@@ d@@ re l@@ or@@ de once said , &quot; NP VP , &apos; NP VP , ADVP NP VP . &apos; &quot; she suggest@@ ed , &quot; NP VP , therefore i am free . &quot;
i think NP VP .
now , american copy@@ right and patent laws run counter IN NP that NP VP .
that is all there is IN NP . apple has pat@@ ented this .
NP VP , and NP VP .
ADVP VP VBZ ADVP . RB NNS VBP NP .
and CD IN NP , NP VP , is NP PP , but certainly in DT NN NN IN NP is NP PP .
it &apos;s IN NP .
so IN NP , there &apos;s NP PP IN NP .
well , this looks IN NP .
and one of the ast@@ on@@ ishing predic@@ tions of quant@@ um mechan@@ ics , just by looking IN NP -- the same theory that descri@@ bes transi@@ stors -- is that there can be no stars in NP SBAR .
it was made IN NP , lo@@ cked RB and RB re@@ turned IN NP VP and , indeed , NNS IN NP .
but PRP VBD NP .
VBP NP .
NP SBAR VBP NP .
RB JJ -- NP VP .
VBP NP PP .
you &apos;re walking to make NP VP . &quot;
i was 27 . i thought NP VP .
and they said , NP VP . &quot;
ADVP NP VP and NP VP .
NP VP , NP ADVP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
but i know NP VP .
but even as a child , i could feel DT NN IN NP .
hope kept NP ADJP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
IN NP , PRP VBD NP NP .
NP ADVP VP , and NP VP , and INTJ VP .
i was asked to VB NP , because NP PP VBD NP .
that &apos;s NP PP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
i brought my japanese students to work IN NP .
NP VP and ADVP NP VP .
and those two ro@@ les came RB IN NP IN NP . &quot;
now why would DT NN IN NP be JJ ?
and RB PRP VBZ NP .
when food is JJ , they diver@@ t nutri@@ ents towards NP , NP , and away from NP PP .
but there &apos;s another way of thinking IN NP .
NN : NP VP .
the audience is led TO VP , in NP , NP .
and if DT NN VBZ NP , it might even make NP VP .
so what PRP VBP S is DT NN IN NP -- i &apos;ll VP -- and perhaps NP PP IN NP .
but NP VP and NP ADVP VP .
NP PP , NP VP NP , ADJP ?
because , if the board of direc@@ tors convince everybody that the success of any organization is almost entirely depen@@ dent on NP VP , it makes the dis@@ par@@ ity in sal@@ aries slightly more justi@@ fi@@ able than if you actually ac@@ knowledge that quite a lot of NP PP &apos;s NP VP .
so the first thing i &apos;d like VP is to come up with NP PP .
NP VP , and PP , SBAR , NP VP .
because NP VP .
but i also learned very soon there@@ after that NP ADVP VP , and NP VP , the poor would always be with PRP .
the truth be told , NP VP , not out of NP PP TO VP and of gener@@ osity .
for the first time , actually , in a long time NP VP , i wanted to VP , CC VP .
i just got this impres@@ sion that NP VP .
because as NP VP , i think S .
so with NP PP , this particular inci@@ dent has led IN NP .
so that &apos;s WDT NP VP .
there is NP JJR CC JJR IN NP .
the universe can spon@@ tane@@ ously create itself out IN NP .
but we are enter@@ ing NP PP .
i &apos;m NP CC NP .
in other words , i look IN NP , and WRB NP VP , they usually look IN NP IN NP .
that &apos;s a degree of an impro@@ vement that would look good IN NP , okay ?
ADVP NP RB ADJP . NP VP , or NP VP .
it would VB NP , ADVP ?
these sorts of ideas don &apos; t really have any v@@ ali@@ di@@ ty , that you can &apos; NP NP .
NP VP all can VB VP
let S is a privi@@ lege because NP VP .
after NP VP , i did DT NN , IN S , VP .
you find NP , NP , NP , NP , ADVP .
PP , NP VP , but NP VP .
what do we actually know IN NP ?
what does DT VB NP ? &quot;
i think NP VP .
for example , g@@ arb@@ age dis@@ charge , something NP VP goes away , but the laws regul@@ ating NN NN IN NP actually get we@@ ak@@ er the further NP VP .
but DT NN NN , NP NP NP , actually is VBG PP PP .
VBG NP PP , WRB NP VP , this was IN NP .
IN NP PRP VBP S , S . PRP VBP S . &quot;
kri@@ st@@ ina g@@ j@@ erde : making NN IN NP
and it &apos;s focus . nor@@ man je@@ wi@@ son said to me , &quot; i think it NP VP . &quot;
WRB VBP NP VP ? is PRP IN S ? or are PRP RB JJ ? DT . NP NP VBZ NP PP .
death : go to NN before NP VP .
and NP VP , and NP VP .
he very carefully and me@@ tic@@ ul@@ ously notes his results in DT NN NN .
and you know , PP , NP VP .
EX VBP NP ADVP . PRP MD VP .
i realize NP VP .
RB DT NN , RB JJ .
it didn NP VP .
it &apos;s RB JJ .
MD NP VP , or MD NP VP ? &quot;
but he made NNS IN NP .
it will stop because IN NP .
i find this argument fascinating , as though we can kind of b@@ end NP PP VP .
i accept WRB NP VP .
imagine NP ADJP , NP CC NP CC NP .
think IN NP .
we need to act like NP VP .
and i will VB and VB NP NP .
and we thought NP VP , but , guess WHNP ?
NN RB VBZ VP .
DT VBZ NP .
graduate students wanted NP PP .
NP VP , ADJP ?
and all NP VP is DT NN .
and about two or three years after they can hear as well as you and i can , they &apos;ll be able to hear maybe WRB NP VP , or WRB NP VP , or WRB NP VP , and other types of ton@@ al sc@@ ales .
i think NP VP .
and the people thought , &quot; NP VP .
so IN NP , they have NP PP .
and so if we look IN NP -- NP SBAR IN NP -- you won &apos; t see it in DT JJ NNS . the new car se@@ ats are far , far better . &quot;
so , let NP VP .
that &apos;s some more evidence , so IN NP -- NP VP , CD VBG NP .
and it turned out that NP VP . but every once in DT NN , there was RB NP SBAR , and he &apos;d VP . and my dad had DT JJ NN IN NP .
it &apos;s IN NP , all this stuff has come .
so , i was trying to RB VB NP .
so by the year 20@@ 40 , the total process@@ ing of this machine will ex@@ ce@@ ed DT JJ NN NN IN NP , in NP CC NP . and this is , PRP VBP , where NP CC NP VBP NP S .
right now , it &apos;s not . if you do spre@@ ad@@ she@@ ets and things at NP , NP , they aren &apos; t on the web , but they are going to VB . they &apos;re going to be NP PP .
NP VP , JJ NNS VBP NP . &quot;
ADVP NP VP -- or NP VP .
so we have NP PP .
but it &apos;ll anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ te WP NP VP .
PRP$ NN IN S started IN NP .
and so i decided to write NP , NP , IN NP .
all NP VP is hum@@ bly follow .
and i organi@@ ze it . and , well , it &apos;s RB NP JJ PP , VP , a dance company finally is a negoti@@ ation between NP , NP , NP , NP , PP , with NP PP and NP , NP .
and it had to do IN NP .
and then the bro@@ a@@ der ideas of NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
we could talk IN NP .
they have 22 satelli@@ tes zi@@ pping around at NP NP , and NP PP .
well , then we get IN NP .
UH , ADVP IN NP .
NP ADVP , NP VP , but ADVP NP VP .
you can continue VP .
this is WP NP VP . &quot;
it &apos;s NP SBAR .
then we would generate something NP VP -- a balance between NP CC NP .
and NP VP and NP VP .
NP , NP VBD PP PP .
the third no@@ ble truth said that NP VP .
and then you do NP VP .
they consu@@ me more co@@ ca leaves than NP , NP , IN NP .
this little boy will never step outside of the sac@@ red fields that surro@@ und NP VP .
so , their entire year has been cut IN NP .
anthropo@@ log@@ ist wa@@ de NN VBZ PP . he shares brea@@ th@@ taking photos and stories of NP , NP .
today , we use NP VP .
the first is sel@@ ec@@ ting NP , RB NP .
it actually takes NP RBR . it takes CD NNS .
good after@@ noon .
now of course , the moment that it does hit NP , CC NP IN NP , it immediately turns back into normal matter .
but NP VP , SBAR , and NP VP .
as DT NN NN , i pro@@ pose NP VP .
WRB NP VP what do PRP VB ? JJ -- S , &quot; NP VP . &quot;
NP VP , and NP VP .
so what you want to do is compare the average number of to@@ s@@ ses until we first see NP VP .
if NP VP , you VBD NP ADVP and VB NP ADVP .
but it turns out that S , NP VP -- NP VP .
RB DT JJ NN VBZ NP .
one explan@@ ation is that NP VP -- that S PP : CC NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
it has to do with wei@@ gh@@ ing up the strength of the other evidence against NP CC NP .
that &apos;s WP NP VP . &quot;
well , a couple of NP CC NP figured out WRB VP .
there are NP PP RB .
and now , today i want to tell PRP NP PP , IN NP .
PP , NP VP ; NP ADVP VP .
and later this year , the ra@@ il minister was sac@@ ked and sent@@ enced to NN IN NP .
at the comm@@ enting area , &#91; it makes &#93; NP RBR like NP , CONJP NP .
IN NP , NP VP , and ADVP NP VP .
ADVP NP VP -- NP VP .
whatever DT NN VBZ , we should fight IN NP .
it &apos;s ac@@ ou@@ stic vi@@ bra@@ tions in NP , NP in NP SBAR .
ADVP VP and NP VP .
NN : ADJP .
so if we had VP is target NP VP .
co@@ ch@@ le@@ ar im@@ plant NP VP .
WP NP VP is IN S .
NP VP , and NP VP .
when i look IN NP , i see a very special audience .
g@@ uns are not NP PP .
WRB NP VP , he never mis@@ sed .
despite the pictures NP VP , wars between developed countries are no longer common@@ place .
the ar@@ med forces imple@@ ment DT NN NN IN NP .
i hope NP VP .
and the interesting thing is that SBAR , NP VP .
we want VP . we want VP .
and RB WP VP ?
women are much more in balance because they don NP VP .
but NP VP , and NP VP .
i &apos;m going to VB NP NP .
RB NNS NP PP .
i mean , you &apos;d think NP VP , but NP VP .
we &apos;re understanding NP SBAR .
NP VP -- SBAR VP .
NP , RB NP ADVP SBAR , and IN S , INTJ , ADVP NP VP , and NP VP .
computers will com@@ bine NP PP IN NP .
NP VP NP VP .
so like NN NN IN NP who wants TO VP ? well , we all do , and the reason for DT is because NP VP .
you &apos;ve been taken IN IN NP .
because there &apos;s NN IN NP . well , alle@@ ge@@ dly there &apos;s nothing .
NP PP VBD NP S .
NP ADVP , but ADVP NP .
well here &apos;s the late , JJ NN NP JJ cra@@ te NN NN IN NP , IN WHNP NP VP .
especially WRB NP VP , you &apos;re VBG IN NP ADVP .
some con@@ spi@@ ra@@ cies really are JJ .
and this is NN IN NP .
PRP VBP NP , and NP VP , and S , CC S , we &apos;d NN NN and se@@ ek .
but later the government soldiers began VP .
but this , sur@@ ely , WP NP VP , WDT NP VP , this is ADJP NN .
so the question is , how do they deal IN NP ?
WP NP VP is NP NP and then move DT NN IN NP .
every now and then , when they clim@@ b on NN IN NP , they wi@@ pe their face .
RB DT VBZ VP . NP VP , NP VP , NP VP , NP VP . JJ : S VBZ NP NP VP .
RB RB VBZ PRP$ JJ NN .
NP VP , NP VP , and NP VP .
you see the sk@@ at@@ ers often trick IN NP . the ob@@ stac@@ les are easier .
sometimes you get a little star appl@@ ause , and then i think ADVP NP VP , and NP VP .
but he was cre@@ di@@ ted with co@@ ining NP , NP . &quot;
i didn NP VP . we took DT NN RB IN NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
and so therefore , the entire purpose of a v@@ c pit@@ ch is to convince them that NP VP .
and now along IN NP , along IN NP and it doesn &apos; t have to be DT NN .
there &apos;s never been an NN - or DT NN - funded company where bad things didn NP VP .
and then from there , you &apos;ve VP .
&quot; PRP VBP NP . there NP NP WHNP S . &quot;
you &apos;re foc@@ using IN NP ! this is steve jobs .
you do NP PRN VP .
there has never been a company that doesn NP VP .
this is that NP VP .
number three : the hand@@ ou@@ ts NP VP are not PRP$ NN .
you can use PRP IN NP .
this is NP PP .
so when i click on NP , NP i get sym@@ pa@@ thetic magic and vo@@ o@@ do@@ o doll@@ s .
WRB NP VP , i get NP SBAR .
by NN , i mean NP : NP CC NP .
last .
because NP VP ?
PRP VBZ NP .
and you can VP , VP , NP . what a du@@ m@@ b idea .
the more you play , the bigger NP ADVP VP .
NP VP , NP VP , NP VP ; NP VP .
IN NP , PRP VBZ NP .
NP , NP VBZ NP .
i don &apos; t care if NP VP .
un@@ accep@@ table . ne@@ pri@@ em@@ li@@ v .
NP PP VBD VP .
my work actually VBD NP PP , and VBD NP NP .
however , NN IN NP spent PRP$ NN IN NP .
so i was ar@@ re@@ sted quite early in NP VP .
this was JJ ! man , i was -- NP NP . i was JJ .
NN IN NP .
ADVP NP , and NP VP .
NP ADVP VP , and ADVP NP VP .
but WDT NP VP was NP , CC NP .
you can VB NP PP .
and we were gr@@ ate@@ ful that i was able TO VP , and i soon learned that NP VP , and then when PRP VBD NP , we learned that NP VP .
and NP VP , and NP VP . &quot;
a@@ v : yeah , and then you have your first child , and then you really res@@ u@@ b@@ mit yourself to these high@@ s and lo@@ ws -- NP VP , DT JJ NN , NP VP -- NP VP , PRP$ NN , any time from six to seven every night .
so the point of NP PP NP-TMP is not just ADVP NP PP , but DT NN that PP , that NP VP .
and , NP VP , it &apos;s NP SBAR .
and RB PRP VBD NP .
your eyes are pretty happy IN NP , you know .
you want to hear it in NP CC NP .
NNP NNP NN : NP , VP
and when NNS VBP NP , they soon think that NP VP .
DT JJ of DT . this is IN NP .
we know NP VP .
and some are quite struc@@ tural , like NP VP , and NP VP .
then mon@@ arch@@ y had seen IN NP .
IN NP , PRP VBP NP PP .
why ? because NP VP and NP VP it &apos;s VBG S . &quot;
well , what i did IN NP was to VB NP .
the survey takes RP DT NN .
it &apos;s current pleasure in NN IN NP .
of course , from NP CC NP .
would he need DT JJ NN IN NP , IN NP ?
we need NP JJR IN ADVP .
they were doing an experiment to do with NP CC NP and NP PP .
patri@@ ci@@ a r@@ y@@ an : VB NP ins@@ ist IN NP !
it turned out that giving the planes to DT NN was worth much more than the de@@ bt , so for NP , NP , i only had to pay one third income ta@@ x .
and then , what population IN NP would be NP SBAR ?
as NP VP , and NP VP , the RBS RB JJ se@@ gment of NP NP has gone RB IN NP , IN PP .
NN : INTJ , NP , 11 .
this del@@ u@@ sion is a kind of prison for us , restri@@ cting us to our personal des@@ ires and to affe@@ ction for NP NP to us .
and he had NP PP .
well , at least i can VB NP and VB NP . &quot;
and ma@@ it@@ re@@ ya says , &quot; NP VP . who do you think S ? &quot;
PRP VBD ADJP . NNS MD VP . NNS CC NNS MD VP .
the mother is NP PP , IN NP .
and so you see NP PP .
and this is WRB NP VP .
RB , NP NP , VBD NP , S .
but there &apos;s NP PP .
we have NP PP .
DT IN NP , IN NP , VB NP called DT NN NNS .
now , if NP VP , you need DT NN .
all right , let me then finish off with NP , NP CC NP .
and i don NP VP , but PP , NP VP .
but it does make NP , CC NP
so , they got DT NNS IN NP , put PRP ADVP IN NP , got DT NNS IN NP , and NN IN NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
NP VP ; NP VP . &quot;
well , just imagine NP VP .
or the op - ed page , where if NP VP -- they could VB NP .
and i was having dinner with NP VP .
if NP VP , and NP VP , you only need CD NN IN NP TO VP , VBG NP , and you &apos;ve VP .
this was NP NP .
NNS IN NP came RB -- NP PP .
and DT VBZ NP , ADVP , S .
NP : FRAG IN NP .
and he said , &quot; NP VP . &quot;
one person sent me DT ADJP NN ; NP NP .
ADVP , NP VP and NP VP and NP VP or ADVP NP VP and ADVP NP VP and ADVP NP VP .
ADVP NP VP , but NP ADVP VP .
but then my mother said to me , &quot; i hear NP VP .
but our grand@@ kids are going VP .
and we re-@@ create the conditions that were JJ JJR IN NP after NP VP .
VB NP PP , and PRP VBP PP , and it &apos;s DT ADJP , ADJP NN . but as NP VP , NP VP , and NP VP , actually , it was just made IN NP .
but what he meant was that WP NP VP , really , is NP VP .
so all the ex@@ qu@@ is@@ itely deta@@ iled calcu@@ lations we can do with that wonderful equ@@ ation wouldn &apos; t be possible IN NP .
RB IN NP NP .
in IN NP , NP VP , and NP CC NP and NP SBAR got NN .
and i &apos;m certainly looking forward with JJ NN to NP VP .
so from NP PP NP IN NP , we s@@ mile RB , and you s@@ mile VP .
s@@ mil@@ ing can help VB NP , VB NP PP and VB NP .
but NP VP , NP VP , NP VP , and NP VP .
and this was not a VP feeling .
we put DT NN RB , CC RB NP .
ef@@ h@@ ari@@ st@@ o and kal@@ in@@ ih@@ ta .
NP VP , VBD VP NP PP .
NN VBZ ADJP .
and not only is it em@@ power@@ ing IN NP , but really importantly , this information sta@@ ys IN NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
but the story is not IN NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
for NP PP , the challenge is VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
but if NP VP , my humanity is RBR IN NP .
PRP VBD NP .
and then the next plan@@ ting seas@@ on , WRB NP VP , they would VB NP .
i cri@@ ed IN NP .
PRP VBD VP .
there are DT IN NP IN NP .
if NP VP , they look IN NP .
and if NP VP .
so about 10,000 years ago by the black sea , we had one mu@@ tation in one gene which led IN NP .
three different op@@ tions .
you can tag them with proteins that light up WRB NP VP .
but one question NP VP is , are PRP VBG NP PP ?
IN NP , NP PP VBD . could PRP VB ADJP ADVP ? IN NP , NP PP S MD VP .
and WRB NP VP there &apos;s NP SBAR .
you can send them inside buildings like DT IN NP to look IN NP , maybe look IN NP , gas@@ e@@ ous lea@@ ks .
so the robot is obviously capable of VBG NP .
so when we have a robot which is surro@@ unded IN NP -- and let &apos;s look IN NP NP CC NP -- what we want the robots to VB is to monit@@ or the separ@@ ation between them as they fly in forma@@ tion .
this is NP VP .
and that &apos;s WRB NP VP .
we &apos;re very co-@@ evolved , because NP VP .
RB NP NP WHNP S . ADVP VP , VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
it &apos;s like , NP , FW NP WP NP VP .
i would like to encoura@@ ge NP VP .
NP VP : NP VP .
but we have , somehow , in NP , CC RB NP , started VP .
and this is true , as NP VP .
the costs have been NP : NP S , NN IN NP .
in fact we do not want this poor woman to work DT NN IN NP .
but UH EX VBP NP .
i want to see NN NNS IN NP .
we need to make NP ADJP because they allow NP VP .
living IN NP RB PP , but if NP VP , there &apos;s NP ADJP SBAR .
NP VP , so NP-TMP NP VP .
and then you can also engage the end user in the design process , and not just ask him what he needs , but ask him how he thinks NP VP .
what my purpose of DT NN NN really is , is to sort IN NP .
and they didn NP VP . they called PRP VP .
and RB DT NN NN VBZ NP .
i mean , just incredible to see bun@@ ches of NP PP again .
and , NP VP , once a tox@@ in is IN S .
so , people talk IN NP .
r@@ w : yes , this is actually the first time anyone of us knew IN NP , IN NP .
and PRP VBZ RB NP .
ADVP NP VP , NP VP , SBAR , NP VP . but , DT VBD ADJP .
and yet , look at DT NN IN NP that are being sold .
but the problem is , NP VP .
it also helps reduce NP PP .
when we looked IN NP -- which is NP PP -- they got worse in the control group , but they actually got better in DT JJ NN , and these differences were highly significant .
it was NP VP .
NN : NP VP .
the human form , in particular the human head , has been considered NP PP .
and RB , IN NP , PRP VBD NP S .
and we also needed to make sure that NP VP .
we started VP .
NP VP , NP VP , NP VP . &quot;
and because NP PP VBD VP , we could trans@@ pose NP PP IN NP IN NP .
and then this is what we called NP NP , VBP NP PP .
so , effectively we created a digital pu@@ p@@ pet that bra@@ d pit@@ t could operate IN NP .
and the bear cu@@ bs were being harv@@ est@@ ed from IN NP and being sold and tra@@ ded .
and then it started , NP VP .
and the beautiful be@@ ars can of course live IN NP RB .
we were IN NP , IN NP , IN NP .
so as we talked , NP , NP VP , maybe i should bring a cam@@ el .
but not a big -- PP , PP , NP VP , so NP VP .
NP VP , ADVP , NP VP .
well , if poor old su@@ ki is IN NP , what would su@@ ki VP ?
i &apos;m built VP .
and i think WRB NP VP , that is NP PP .
when i was po@@ et lau@@ re@@ ate , there i go again -- i can &apos; t help NP , NP VP -- i created a poetry chan@@ nel on del@@ ta air@@ lines that la@@ sted IN NP .
some days i put DT NNS IN NP IN NP , VP .
the po@@ em that &apos;s coming up is based on him trying to tell me a little something about a dom@@ esti@@ c point of NP PP living that NP VP , at first , process@@ ing .
i just have time to VB NP PP .
and so it makes NP VP
the wol@@ f is , IN NP , NP .
PRP VBZ ADVP NP .
and so what we do IN NP is NP VP , and NP VP -- because SBAR , NP VP and NP VP .
humans y@@ a@@ wn WRB NP VP .
IN NP , PRP VBD NP NP .
and so we found that NP VP - being IN NP -- especially , these are NP PP .
and that &apos;s WP NP VP .
so let NP VP .
so first , if NP VP , VB NP , not NP .
but i decided to learn about NP CC NP by NP PP and trying to live PRP and immer@@ se PRP IN NP .
and my imm@@ un@@ ologist told me that NP VP .
without DT NN NN .
but i think NP VP .
so WP NP VP , when NN VBD ADJP , people were more likely VP .
but i didn NP VP .
S , NP VP , but NP VP .
RB NP RB NP .
and perhaps one ar@@ che@@ ologist becomes NP NP .
or RB DT JJ ?
so as PRP VBD NP , they &apos;re usually found IN NP .
now there &apos;s several thoughts . there &apos;s e@@ . NP VP , c or d , right ?
we found that the indu@@ s scri@@ pt actually falls IN NP .
DT VBZ NP .
today , we can write DT NN JJ IN NP , because NP VP .
and this is NP VP .
VBG NP , wat@@ son was IN NP .
a myster@@ i@@ ous per@@ si@@ stent noise was VBG NP .
and as soon as PRP VBD VP , he per@@ formed DT NN IN NP . everyone looked IN NP , and they saw IN NP IN NP .
because NP SBAR , then that puts PRP IN NP ?
NP VP , NP VP -- and ADVP NP VP .
look IN NP ch@@ ih@@ o showed us . she sc@@ ared us with DT NN NN .
this is bir@@ han , who VBD NP , and that NP PP VBZ NP .
but it took CD NNS IN NP VP .
NP VP and NP VP .
i have just been talking IN NP .
so we have got to create in this world also institutions for NP CC NP , but also for NP PP .
so you go IN NP .
the foot is distribu@@ ted IN NP .
not just with NP , CONJP NP .
and where they have DT NN IN NP , because NP VP &apos; t have sp@@ ines .
it &apos;s a secret . the animal effectively clim@@ bs by VP to VP .
watch what happens when the foot goes IN NP .
we discovered NP VP .
and here it is coming RP IN NP , IN NP IN NP .
ADVP VP NP : SBAR , NP VP .
NP VP and NP VP , you ought VP .
as NP VP , they share NP , PP . &quot;
notice how few barri@@ ers there are IN NP IN NP .
hum@@ p@@ bac@@ ks , WRB NP VP , they &apos;re VP .
but you can RB VB NP .
i &apos;ll VB NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
at the same time , we need to be really creative in NN IN NP to be JJ S .
ADVP , NP VP : NP VP .
NP VP : S : and NP VP .
it &apos;s a social aw@@ k@@ war@@ dness like NP VP .
that means NP VP .
we have so much technology no@@ wa@@ days that these inter@@ faces should start con@@ forming IN NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
corruption ? poverty ? or is PRP NN RB ?
we want to go on with our daily life even though we are not living IN NP .
recently -- NP VP -- 35 public ly@@ n@@ ch@@ ings have VBN VP .
with NP VP , mexico would VB NP .
NP VP -- NP VP .
thanks . thank you . now , ju@@ g@@ gling can be NP PP ; play IN NP and play IN NP , play IN NP .
or you can VP CC VP . now , sk@@ ill .
VB NP ADVP .
NN , NN , NN , NN , NN , NN , NN , NN .
why the hell should PRP VB NP ? ok ?
and WP VBP NP VP ?
i app@@ ren@@ tic@@ ed IN NP and learned NP , NP CC NP .
and NP : VP -- NP VP .
and so thinking RB , i was thinking NP VP -- certainly technologi@@ cal objects .
NP VP -- NP VP -- but NP VP .
then when you ex@@ it the ima@@ x the@@ at@@ re on NP : RB NP , also designed by NN NN bis@@ ho@@ p &#93; and NN NN NN NN IN NP .
and of course : DT NN IN NP stre@@ t@@ ches IN NP .
you watch the video with super@@ im@@ posed graphi@@ cs that indi@@ cate NP CC NP .
there is more IN NP than NP VP , actually .
DT NN VBZ RB ADJP . &quot;
NP PP : NP , ADJP .
and i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and he said , &quot; why can &apos; NN NP ? &quot;
i find that NP , RB VP .
&quot; why are we here ? &quot; and &quot; what should we do about PRP while NP VP ?
this is RB JJ , but RB RB JJ .
so you have five million , that is , NP CC NP VBZ NP .
two ro@@ ws from DT NN IN NP .
and it turns out that NP VP .
so that &apos;s sort of WP NP VP .
we have to make this available IN NP . &quot;
and when that happens , NP VP we have to understand PRP$ NN , our present and human culture .
but DT VBZ RB NP .
this is not JJ .
or just try this one on IN NP .
and if we can teach VBG PP , we can take our listening IN NP IN NP and move it to NP SBAR -- or NP PP .
and mean@@ while , i was tour@@ ing lo@@ cally and playing in ni@@ ght@@ clu@@ bs with NP , NP .
i &apos;ve always been with NP CC NP .
and this starts VBG NP .
this is NP PP .
well let NP VP , IN NP , the euro@@ zone has collap@@ sed ... what else ?
actually , that NP VP , and WP NP VP are NN NNS IN NP .
NP ADVP VP , NP VP , NP VP .
PRP VBP NP : NP VP and NP VP .
i thought NP VP .
NP VP -- NP VP .
and PRP VBZ NP . RB WRB VBZ NP VP ?
and finally , some people say , well , NP VP , i don NP VP , you know . i &apos;m conscious .
NN VBZ NP . NP VP , ADVP , NP VP , NP VP , NP VP , NP VP , NP VP , NP VP , NP VP .
and that somehow , predi@@ ction leads IN NP .
and in the future , when it sees something similar IN NP , so IN NP , or the ex@@ act same environment , it &apos;ll play it back . it &apos;ll start VBG NP ADVP .
door , door , door , NP VP , NN , S .
then , if IN NP , you take DT NN IN NP .
no dou@@ bt that NP VP , in my mind .
i &apos;m actually here to make DT NN IN NP .
NP PP , SBAR , NP VP -- NP VP ...
i spoke IN NP NP RB .
but if NP VP , it was ADJP : NP .
but it was the actions , together , of DT IN NP WDT VP .
today , in NP CC NP , people are VBG NP .
but when i lec@@ ture IN NP , they tell me , &quot; NP , NP VP . &quot;
RB , JJ NN .
it &apos;s NP PP .
i would like to VB NP NP .
do you see where i &apos;m going IN NP ?
dis@@ crimin@@ ation was happening IN NP .
NP VP , NP VP NP VP and NP-TMP NP ADVP VP .
PRP VBP ADJP . PRP VBP NP .
i once -- this was years ago -- i saw ted ken@@ ne@@ dy and dan qua@@ yle meet in NP PP .
and it &apos;s led to a view of human nature that NP VP , and NP VP .
S , CC S , so NP VP , NP VP -- NP VP .
people with NNS CC NNS IN NP are not super smart , NP VP quite hel@@ pl@@ ess .
but NP VP , NP VP , and NP VP .
QP NN IN NP say S .
but this is NP PP .
VBP NP .
and PRP VBP NP NP .
NP VP : NP VP .
she works for NP VP .
it &apos;s very fashi@@ on@@ able to talk IN NP , in this fantastic a-@@ c hall .
NP VP , PRP VBP S .
just to let NP VP , i do not have a le@@ xi@@ co@@ graphi@@ cal whi@@ st@@ le .
computers ! WP IN NP ?
so -- -- now , when you think IN NP is a ham bu@@ tt problem .
no . there will RB VB NP .
you didn JJ NN VB NP . it &apos;s just IN NP , and IN S .
SBAR , NP VP , and NP VP .
because NP VP .
CC NP VP -- NP VP .
DT NN VBD NP-TMP .
NP VP , and NP VP . RB , RB CD NN : NP VP ? &quot;
je@@ ff be@@ z@@ os kin@@ dly re@@ mar@@ ked IN NP , NP , NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
for one thing , gps doesn &apos; t work in@@ do@@ ors , and for another , they don NP VP .
in NN , as NP VP , i discovered IN NP IN S .
so let NP VP .
so something felt RB JJ IN NP .
we call NP NP , and we live and work IN NP .
DT VBZ NP .
but as soon as NP VP , it would start VP .
and once a cre@@ ature po@@ ps into our minds , NP VP and WP NN NP VP .
but NP VP , and NP VP .
li@@ ke@@ wise , with solar , especially here in california , we &apos;re disco@@ vering that NP VP .
so argu@@ ing against , a man who &apos;s been IN NP IN NP .
and this doesn &apos; t even account IN NP .
IN NP , PRP VBZ NP .
nuclear , the time lag alone will allow the arc@@ tic to VB and NP S .
VBG NP &apos;s problems can VP CC VP .
VBP NP .
so DT IN NP has NP SBAR .
sh@@ am@@ eless . sh@@ am@@ eless . sh@@ am@@ eless .
we explore IN NP .
the shu@@ ttle is VBG NP NP .
100 bucks . that &apos;s the price - improvement cur@@ ve that -- we need NP PP along the way , i &apos;ll NN NP NP .
NP VP -- NP VP .
when you want the taste that won NP VP , the only way to go is up .
then , NP VP , NP VP , face NP PP , it &apos;ll never work .
NP NP , NN , is NP PP .
i designed NP SBAR .
and unlike traditional architecture , it &apos;s a single process that creates CC NP CC NP .
NP VP , but ADVP NP VP .
there &apos;s that di@@ p RB IN NP .
you we@@ ed down through various steps that cause NP PP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
so i just want to say a couple more things about that particular story , and then try to gener@@ alize how could we have NNS IN NP all over NP PP , as NP VP , these 4@@ ,000 that are waiting for answers .
you probably know , if you &apos;ve been paying attention to some of the science liter@@ ature that you can now take a skin cell and encoura@@ ge it to become NP CC NP or NP CC NP for NP PP .
if you don NP VP , just ask sam .
and for us young people , they &apos;re looking to VB NP and VB NP PP .
we &apos;re here , NP VP , VP CC VP .
NP VP and NP VP .
us@@ eless .
NP VP -- NP VP .
at that age , obviously , i couldn NP VP , but i told her NP VP .
it became NN IN NP .
and i looked IN NP IN NP . and DT IN NP was JJ .
so to VB NP ADVP , i decided that NP VP .
can anybody see the bla@@ de on NP PP ?
and i looked IN NP IN NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
i used NP PP VP .
constru@@ cted NP PP .
and NP CC NP , DT JJ NNS IN NP , re@@ fer to NP PP that VP .
all NP VP is TO VP .
and these should also be NP PP .
and one day i was explor@@ ing NP VP .
the next day i came VP . i was INTJ , NP , NP VP . &quot;
in NNS they don NP ADVP VP . &quot;
CC NP VP have you ever been NP VP ? &quot;
two weeks after my diagno@@ sis , a bi@@ op@@ sy con@@ fir@@ med NP VP .
and PRP VBD PRT NP , and NP VP , and NP VP .
and NP PP VBD NP .
don NP VP .
and NP VP and NP VP they love .
so if NP VP , or if NP VP , you can click IN NP .
a@@ o : you did teach PRP TO VP , and as a con@@ sequence , playing the piano for NP , NP , was a lot of NP CC NP , and even a bit of nose going on in RB .
and hopefully we can show the audience now how it is NP VP .
dp : &quot; NN IN NP .
NN : NP VP . NNP NNP : VP NP . &quot;
NP VP ; NP VP .
does NN VB ? ch@@ i ?
they &apos;re fighting to develop NP , NP , NP .
and we use NP VP .
we now know that PP , NP VP .
so , the sad thing is that NP VP .
the one thing we have , which makes us so different from NP CC NP , is this sophisti@@ cated spo@@ ken language -- a language with which we can tell NNS IN NP .
there &apos;s little bro@@ ch@@ ures all around outside , and if any of you have anything to do IN NP and care IN NP , i be@@ g that you pick up that bro@@ ch@@ ure .
we want to go and spend NN IN NP and VB NP and VB NP .
and i believe that NP VP .
it &apos;s in NP CC NP and NP PP .
so how do PRP VB NP ? well , we use NP SBAR .
it could run DT NN IN NP .
it can VB NP and RB VB NP S .
so since NP VP , and NP VP , perhaps these proto@@ cells have something VP . perhaps these represent DT ADJP NN , NP PP .
this is used IN NP IN NP IN NP , WHADVP S . if NP VP and NP VP , how could we RB recognize PRP IN NP ?
NP PP VBD VP .
the cul@@ min@@ ation of DT is if NP VP , you will then go and introdu@@ ce PRP$ NN IN NP and disc@@ uss DT NN IN S .
ADVP VP NP -- SBAR , NP VP .
WP NP VP is NP , SBAR .
and then i VBP NP PRT PP and RB VB NP .
and an early test WDT NP VP decided that NP VP .
in this case , instead of thro@@ wing che@@ wing g@@ um , or dor@@ it@@ os or whatever you have IN NP IN NP -- there &apos;s DT NN IN NP in NP SBAR , it &apos;s actually white bread from people fe@@ eding the fish and the birds .
did you know that today we main@@ tain NP PP VP ?
the animal could be NP , NP , or even NP ADJP .
it need not look IN NP .
he didn JJ NN NN RB NP CC NP . &quot;
and NN RB VBZ NP .
we actually think NP VP .
and RB , PRP VBZ NP .
so my mom said , &quot; NP VP . &quot;
he &apos;s like , S , NP VP .
NP NP , PRP VBP S .
when i was NP JJ , it was necessary for me to VP CC VP where PRP VBD NP .
PRP MD VP . VB .
we worked with a lot of companies in brazil that put money into NP , NP .
NP VP -- PP , NP VP .
we here inside the room , i believe that NP VP , we can transp@@ l@@ ant it here .
NP VP and NP VP .
you can see NP VP , and NP SBAR .
we know that NP VP .
and rapi@@ dly we started to realize that NP VP .
and perhaps a black bear walked IN . and maybe na@@ tive americans were RB .
and even though NP VP , i hope NP VP .
and , NP VP , built NP SBAR .
and they may not want to live RB IN NP .
and people who live in NNS IN NP tend to be very pro@@ sper@@ ous , and th@@ us use DT NN IN NP .
NP VP , and PP NP VP .
JJS IN NP c@@ ites S .
NP PP VBZ NP .
S , NP VP , but NP VP .
here &apos;s a design for VBG NP S .
you know , that NP VP .
sop@@ a stands IN NP .
NP VP , but NP-TMP NP VP .
that is NP PP .
so this is the internet NP VP .
they don NP VP .
PRP VBD NP .
S WP VBP NP VP ?
so the college works following NP PP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
but NP SBAR VBP NP .
she has NP , NP , NP .
NP VP , NP VP , NP VP , and NP ADVP VP .
and PRP NP NP VBD .
i knew WDT NN NP VP .
don NP VP .
our narra@@ tive here is NP SBAR .
NN , NN CC NN VBP NP .
and yet in CD CD years the human brain has nearly tri@@ pl@@ ed IN NP , VP , IN NP .
because the fact is that NP PP , lot@@ tery w@@ inn@@ ers and par@@ ap@@ legi@@ cs are equ@@ ally happy with their lives .
who are NP SBAR ?
and then finally -- you know , NP VP .
in this case , because the experiment NP VP uses them , these are mon@@ et prin@@ ts .
we expla@@ ined NP VP .
it turns out that NP VP .
ADVP NP VP ; NP VP ; NP VP .
they don JJ NN IN NP , and in NN even after NP VP , they still don JJ NN IN NP . why ?
VBP NP .
RB NP ADVP VP .
NP VP -- NP VP .
JJ NN , NN . &quot;
i was born IN NP -- i forget , and i came IN NP IN NP .
and that meant that NP VP , NP VP , NP VP .
NP VP -- NP VP .
it &apos;ll VB NP . it &apos;ll VB NP PP , ADVP .
now , you have all been IN NP IN NP , UH ?
by now , we have now cra@@ w@@ led another four feet , and my mother finally says to me , &quot; i knew NP , NP VP .
we &apos;ll wait IN NP . ok .
&quot; NP , NP , she &apos;s VP .
NP VP , NN NN ?
PRP RB VBP NP .
what zi@@ p@@ car does is we park cars throughout den@@ se urban areas for members to reser@@ ve , IN NP and IN NP , instead of VP .
NP VP : SBAR , VP .
so again , we can see that price plays an enormous role in NP NP to VB NP .
these are RB VBN NP .
these are NP PP .
and this open - source version means that NP VP -- if we did NP PP -- it could be used IN NP RB RB .
CD VBD NP .
and as NP VP , and NP VP , i said to PRP WDT NP ADVP VP .
i &apos;d love to just talk IN NP .
so there was a time WRB NP VP ever hit@@ ting NP PP ADVP IN NP .
so those are NP NP .
NP VP , NP VBP NP VP ? &quot;
and DT VBZ NP .
tour@@ ist : i think that NP VP .
and i thought NP VP .
NNP : NP VP .
so dealing IN NP is just an immedi@@ ate master plan .
sort of IN NP WRB NP VP , i guess ?
PRP VBZ NP .
and i truly believe until NP VP .
DT NNS IN NP ?
so you can get kind IN NP for DT .
but how about NP , CC NP ?
let NP VP .
WRB JJ NP VP ?
and NP-TMP , NP VP VP CC : NP .
NP VP , but PP , NP VP .
IN NP , NP PP VBD S .
NP VP , NP VP , and NP VP .
so sur@@ ely if a patent pool could be establi@@ shed IN NP IN NP , we should be able to VB S .
the rule is IN NP VP .
what about ath@@ ens ? medi@@ ter@@ ran@@ e@@ an climate , but in DT NN it was not JJ . they didn NP VP .
instead of blo@@ wing NP PP IN NP , we can use JJ NP-TMP system WRB NP VP .
and i also hope that NP VP .
the main thing is a fix - it - locally culture , which is fantastic because it means that NP VP .
PRP VBP ADVP NP , ADVP .
so we are right now doing some syste@@ matic field tests to basically as@@ certain whether NN IN NP actually makes NN IN NP .
and i started to see the world in a whole new way , like pa@@ irs of NP VP .
and , RBS RB , WP VBZ NP ?
and we thought NP VP .
i mean , NP VP , NP VP , an@@ ger or happiness .
RB VP -- NP VP .
DT VBZ NP . &quot;
they &apos;re NP VP , and RB NP PP VBZ NP and PRP VBP NP .
you read IN NP IN NP .
the c@@ d@@ c recently condu@@ cted a survey where they asked respon@@ dents simply to tell them whether NP VP .
PP , NP VP , but NP VP .
we go IN NP .
NP VP , DT VBZ ADVP NP .
PRP VBD NP .
the l@@ x@@ d VB NP PP , re@@ v@@ ved up by DT NN . in DT NN IN NP &apos;s up@@ coming web series , this ast@@ on@@ ishing trou@@ pe VP .
according IN NP , those lands are DT JJ NN .
PRP VBD NP .
on dec@@ ember 2@@ 9@@ th , u.s. tro@@ ops surro@@ unded DT NN NN IN NP and mas@@ sac@@ red NP PP , VP .
2010 : statistics about na@@ tive population today , more than a century after the mas@@ sac@@ re at wo@@ unded k@@ nee , reve@@ al the leg@@ acy of NP , NP CC NP .
those events led IN NP .
so , that NP , VP , VB NP PP , have NP VP .
many of these dea@@ ths were completely pre@@ vent@@ able , and this what i want to think IN IN NP .
VBG . VP VBZ NP .
RB , RB VBP NP . NP VP , NP VP , NP VP . WRB VBP NP VP ?
so , somebody out there says , VB NP . &quot;
RB out IN NP .
they are saying , &quot; DT VBZ NP . i &apos;m going to VB NP , i &apos;m going to buy NP , NP . &quot;
RB , NP VP , and ADVP NP VP . ok ?
NP : NP VP , and NP VP .
NP , NP , VBP VP .
ma@@ car@@ th@@ ur w@@ inner sen@@ d@@ hi@@ l mul@@ la@@ in@@ a@@ than uses the l@@ ens of behavi@@ oral economics to study NP PP -- NP SBAR , but don &apos; t . we know how to VB NP PP , how to VB NP and how to VB NP ... yet somehow , we don &apos; t or can &apos; t . why ?
right , the current wants to run IN NP , not IN NP .
so i would encoura@@ ge you all to VB NP , VB NP , VB NP and start playing .
and a friend of NP PP felt so sorry IN NP that NP VP .
but i will VB NP S . so , first , we viol@@ ate NP , NP . NP PP , IN S -- DT IN NP . not you .
RB , PRP VBP NP .
DT VBZ NP . PRP IN NP .
so here NP VP , actually -- i know RB WRB NP VP .
and if you work with , IN NP , with NN , you have -- that &apos;s the pas@@ s@@ word to NP PP , where you can find NP PP .
and RB , NP VP , NN -- S CC S .
WRB NP VP , i pe@@ ek .
PRP VBP NP ADVP .
this is a kind of NP , NP ?
now -- -- one guy laugh@@ ed . so now , to VB NP , do it this way : VP , VP .
NN IN NP .
do with NP , CC NP . yes , good , good .
right ? good .
CD -- CC NP VP ?
yes ? NP .
NN IN NP . NNP : UH !
now , what happened was not maybe what you thought , which is , NP ADVP VP , NP VP , or whatever it is .
and your children are VBG NP .
NP HYPH JJ people , they &apos;re no longer here .
now , it goes down IN NP now to NN and then to NN .
and RB RB ...
finally , i said , NN WRB VBP NP NP ? &quot;
he depen@@ ds , IN NP , IN NP .
unfortunately , it was the last thing NP ADVP VP . he did not survive .
DT IN NP might VB VP .
PRP VBZ NP .
so gl@@ u@@ ck@@ s@@ berg did another experiment similar IN NP WRB NP VP up here . okay ?
the rules are JJ .
WP VP ?
these are NP PP .
PRP VBZ ADVP PRP VBZ RB ADJP . NP VP , but NP VP .
do it for NN . no one gets paid NP , CC NP .
so , it can balance IN NP .
so here is the earth . it &apos;s a little less than a milli@@ meter that was turned IN NP .
this is NP PP .
and NP SBAR -- or NP , SBAR WRB NP VP .
it &apos;s RB JJ CC JJ .
the real social innovation NP VP invol@@ ves char@@ ity .
NP VP , PRP VBP S .
char@@ it@@ able giving has rema@@ ined JJ , in DT NN , at NP PP RB since NP VP .
well , like NP PP , these ideas come IN NP .
within nine years , we had multi@@ pli@@ ed IN NP PP IN NP .
but if NP VP , that would VB NP PP , and if NP VP , that would VB NP .
and suddenly , out of NP , NP .
NP VP , NP , INTJ , VP .
can PRP VB NP ? would PRP VB NP ?
and PRP$ NN IN NP . , etc . ... &quot;
and then like kar@@ a@@ j@@ an . let NP VP . okay ?
meaning that NP VP have no auth@@ ority TO VP .
this is very exciting IN NP .
rather enjo@@ ying WP NP VP .
you know WHADVP ? because NP PP VBZ NP .
but all my work for many years was focused around DT NN that NP VP .
but are we to assu@@ me that NP VP ?
and IN NP , VBZ NP .
it lear@@ ns RB RB IN NP .
so it started out with some work NP VP since spread .
IN PP , NP ADVP VP , NP VP .
well , this is IN NP .
NP VP : NP VP .
is anyone paying attention to NP PP NP VP ?
and unfortunately , as NP VP , people VBP ADJP and VB , S .
so what do we need VP ?
it allows NP VP .
and after two more years of VBG NP , i decided to sho@@ ot IN NP .
NP NP VP , but NP VP .
NP VP MD VP .
DT NNS PRP RB VBP VP .
RB RB , JJ .
don &apos; t they just pop IN NP ?
PRP VBZ ADJP . PRP VBZ NP .
VBD NP VP , VBP NP has RB VBN NP , SBAR .
DT JJ NML NN VBZ NP .
and i expla@@ ined , &quot; NP VP and NP VP . &quot;
yes , it means NP VP .
we become NNS IN NP and start VP .
PRP VP CC VP , VP ! &quot; NP VP .
NN VBZ NP .
RB NP CC NP VBD NP . DT VBZ NP .
NP NP , IN NP , VBD NP .
i had been using NP PP VP , NP VP .
climate change den@@ i@@ ers argue that NP VP .
me@@ than@@ e is also beginning to es@@ cape IN NP .
it would be im@@ moral to leave these young people with NP VP .
DT NN VBZ ADJP .
NP CC NP VBZ NP .
we can VB NP ADVP ADVP .
i sort of forget how bizar@@ re DT IN NP are .
two st@@ unt guys doing WP NP VP .
it &apos;s that NP VP .
NP VP ; NP VP .
i cont@@ ac@@ ted a company in the states who make NP PP .
DT VBZ NP . PRP VBZ NP .
but if PRP VBP , and NP VP , NP VP , NP VP , &quot; what do PRP VB ? &quot;
do you remember DT NN ? no , it was JJ .
in NN , we moved IN NP IN NP .
why not ? i think NP VP .
so the hier@@ arch@@ y is ro@@ ot@@ ed IN NP .
in fact , creativity -- which i define IN NP -- more often than not comes about through the interaction of NP PP .
i said , VP ? &quot;
now is NP PP S .
so i re@@ treated back to my ca@@ ve and continu@@ ed to support and produce com@@ e@@ dy and let NP VP .
so everywhere NP VP , we audi@@ tioned ama@@ te@@ urs .
one : is the middle east being shown in NP CC NP ?
early NN , NP , NP &apos;s NP PP .
fif@@ ty percent will have NN IN NP , NP , NP , NP .
the important piece here is that as NP VP , you find IN S , but there are some predic@@ table patterns , and those patterns are risk fac@@ tors for VP .
but this tells us WRB NP VP , and WRB NP VP .
WHADJP NNS MD NP VP ?
but WRB JJ NP VP .
it &apos;s very interesting . when PRP VBD NP the parents would give NNS IN NP .
there they met children who are with NP CC NP .
is it the ex@@ pos@@ ure ? we have profess@@ ors from NP , NP , NP , NP WHNP S .
WRB NP VP i began IN NP .
ADVP NP VP , and NP VP . IN S , PRP VBP S .
you should be looking IN NP . &quot;
every JJ way NP VP , he vari@@ ed sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tt@@ i sau@@ ce .
what howard did is he fundament@@ ally changed the way NP VP .
RB RBR NP , RB NP . and WP VBP NP VP ?
and she ser@@ ves NP NP ADVP , and if NP VP , she will VP , VP ? you &apos;re wrong ! this is DT JJS NN S . &quot;
if i were VP i asked you to rate that NP , NP MD VP .
we have pre-@@ can@@ cer@@ ous les@@ i@@ ons , which often don JJ NN NN IN NP .
if NP VP , you &apos;re RP DT NN .
it was when i became a journalist that i really realized WRB NP VP , and how we all are NN IN NP .
so , NP VP , NNS , WHADVP S actually hit NP PP IN NP .
and , yeah , we can VP CC VP . but that &apos;s -- IN NP RB NP . he understood NP PP .
and if NP VP , you get FRAG .
so i wrote DT NN IN NP , but IN S , PRP VBD S , and NP VP , so NP VP .
we could do NP SBAR .
WRB VBZ NP ADJP ?
now maybe that NP VP , i had never seen NP PP IN NP .
and the key detail of this is that NP VP and NP VP .
because from WP NP VP , the three things gay americans seem to VB NP .
but NP VP -- SBAR , NP VP .
that is a lot of NN IN NP .
WHADVP ADVP VBZ NP VP ? WHADVP ADVP VBZ NP VP ?
it reach@@ es up to almost 5,000 pounds -- on DT NN IN NP , pri@@ mar@@ ily .
they school IN NP , and become NN NNS IN NP .
so the great thing about the mol@@ a is that when we put the tag on them -- if you look up here -- that NP VP , that &apos;s right where we put the tag .
and they come and give the mol@@ as -- NP VP , but NP VP . &quot;
but also what &apos;s important is that they &apos;re NP , NP .
it was a 200 - foot diam@@ e@@ ter ge@@ o@@ des@@ ic sphere to be sus@@ pen@@ ded IN NP , IN NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
how does it feel to see someone like NP VP ?
he realized at once what VBD VP .
RB , VP DT VBP NP ?
and then ab@@ original women in africa would come and say , &quot; this VBZ NP ! &quot;
i have NP SBAR .
PRP$ NNS VBD NP .
hell@@ o NP VP afford VP .
NP VP , NNS VBP NP . &quot;
NP INTJ ... PP NP VP .
and lei@@ b@@ ni@@ z was the first person to really talk about VBG NP .
NP , CC NP , and NP PP put DT RB . then , they needed DT NN VP .
so , there &apos;s NP PP , IN NP .
&quot; mani@@ a@@ c re@@ ga@@ ined its memory , WRB NP VP . &quot; &quot; machine or human ? &quot;
DT RB VBZ NP .
so he VBD NP , and VBD NP .
and it was NP PP .
and DT VBZ NP .
look at NN IN NP , IN NP sa@@ ke .
i went to NP , NP .
NP VP , NP VP and NP ADVP VP ; PRP VBZ NP .
ADVP NP VP , and NP VP .
normal . let &apos;s get on NP , NP .
they have NP PP , but NP CC NP ? no .
i want to talk IN NP IN NP .
NP , NP , VBZ ADJP .
so , these guys are going to be NN IN NP .
NNP VBZ NP . NP , SBAR , NP VP , PRP VBP SBAR .
JJ , so NP VP .
in fact , a friend of mine from the security industry told me the other day that there are NP : NP , CC NP .
they &apos;re completely anony@@ mous , as NP VP .
and that challenge is : how do you do business , how do you trust somebody on the web who you want to do business with when you know that NP VP ?
now he developed PRP$ ADJP NN IN NP IN NP .
and DT NN IN NP is RB VBG NP .
thank you very much for VP .
public health is another reason to VB NP .
and NP , VP , VBZ NP SBAR .
it &apos;s been so successful , they &apos;ve now taken over DT NN IN NP .
this one is one of NP , NP .
you want to also try to VB NP .
the first is VP .
but we &apos;ve VP .
so i decided to talk IN NP .
and NP VP -- and NP VP .
CC ADVP PP , NP VP , &quot; let NP VP .
and i really love hearing about all these species at DT NN IN NP .
NP VP , and PP , NP VP .
but , S , NP VP , and NP VP .
well , it seems to me that NP PP VBZ ADJP , but ultimately i as@@ cri@@ be it to NP PP , IN NP and de@@ fe@@ at mat@@ ched IN NP .
and then one day , it happened : he and his family were ar@@ re@@ sted and they were taken IN NP IN NP .
mr. tes@@ z@@ ler hi@@ red NP : NP .
and PP , NP VP ; NP VP .
CC NP VP -- NP VP .
and i -- NP VP , ADVP NP VP , and NP VP it &apos;s DT NN IN NP . &quot;
and in about 199@@ 7 , the then - director phili@@ ppe de mon@@ te@@ b@@ ell@@ o gave me the go - RP to VB NP . we normally have these very long NN - IN NP .
and in this extraordinary setting , the co@@ st@@ um@@ es were IN NP , or VP .
i &apos;m working to try and break down DT NN IN NP .
but NP VP , and NP VP .
so we came RP IN NP .
so i VBD PP , CC NP ADVP , NP NP .
and really when you think &#91; NP VP can not do it , she will VB NP , and i can VB NP .
i &apos;m going to take you on NP PP , so bu@@ ck@@ le up .
NP VP , NP VP , NP VP .
and like a living organis@@ m , NP VP , it VBZ NP , VBZ PRT S , VBZ , VBZ NP ADVP .
ADVP , NP VP : NP VP ; NP VP .
we st@@ um@@ bled IN NP , VP .
near that was me@@ than@@ e . i &apos;ve never seen NP PP .
fortunately , we &apos;ve been able to VB NP .
this is NP PP .
VBP NP ADVP .
let NP VP .
since NP VP , we now have NP PP .
other students might be interested IN NP .
in NP PP and NP PP , we can also NP CONJP NP .
which VBZ RB NP i have ever off@@ ered IN NP .
and finally , there was a population of students that were taught in NP VP .
you can see , for NN , that NP ADVP VP .
k@@ ak@@ i king : playing NP PP
&quot; learn NP . &quot;
RB NP : NP . WP VBD NP VP ?
i don NP VP -- maybe it &apos;s JJ RB , or maybe you were VBG NP -- but in JJ NN NNS IN NP , until RB RB UH , PP , NP , VP , NP VP , &quot; NP VP . &quot; yeah .
so this whole subject - object thing has NN IN NP .
and i was sort of , as NP VP .
if they had VBN NP , my grandmother would have lost IN NP .
this is WP NP VP .
and DT NN VBZ ADJP .
and i like to explore all the possibilities in the hope that you &apos;ll be IN NP .
there are RB NP VP .
CD , NP VP . NP ADVP VP -- NP VP .
NP VP ; NP VP .
NN CD : NN NN NN .
now , NP VP , we think , IN NP .
we need to learn how VP VBZ NP .
we &apos;ve NP : NP .
but NP VP , and NP VP .
IN NP , S , VBZ NP .
WRB NP VP , they actually land@@ ed IN NP .
NN VBD NP .
and NP PP .
all right , let NP VP .
NN : PP , NP VP .
we are already l@@ ac@@ ed up as if NP VP .
this is going to be much more powerful than having NP PP , then move to a new location .
PRP VBP NP PP , and NP VP , and NP VP .
so we can bring DT ADJP NN IN NP , IN NP .
and i think that NP ADVP VP .
and yet that energy and power of NN has driven NP SBAR .
it &apos;s like NP VP .
our whole practice depen@@ ds IN NP .
and i do believe that NP VP .
so again , the un@@ expected which VBZ ADVP NP .
and it &apos;s CONJP NP , CC NP .
it &apos;s about creating IN NP .
com@@ promise , if NP VP , if NP VP -- and NP VP -- it &apos;s RB RB RB RB .
that sort of over@@ all sustainable energy problem is the biggest problem that we have to solve NP , NP .
NP , SBAR , VP , VP .
by the end of this year , you &apos;ll be able to drive from NP PP RB VBG NP .
WP VBP NP VP ?
you &apos;re NP PP .
would NN VB NP ?
it &apos;s much like IN NP .
NP VP -- NP-TMP , NP VP .
el@@ on mus@@ k , i wish NP VP .
i grew up her@@ ding , looking after NP : NP .
because NP VP , the british .@@ 3@@ 0@@ 3 ri@@ f@@ le was RB RB IN NP .
and th@@ us , as people started VP and that &apos;s actually becoming NP PP IN NP .
NP SBAR VBZ NP .
IN NP , NN VBD NP .
it allows for NP VP .
well , how many bot@@ tles is it before NP VP ?
so i think NP VP .
they got more cal@@ ories over NP PP .
i remember RB NP PP .
VBP NP .
and the great ir@@ ony and trage@@ dy of our time is that a lot of the general public thinks that science is still argu@@ ing IN NP .
ADVP , NP VP , and NP VP .
you see NP VP .
finally cat@@ ches RP IN NP , it advan@@ ces .
NP VP and NP VP .
but WP NP VP is DT NN NN IN S .
S , ADVP S , but NP VP . &quot;
they were working on NP , CC NP , have already ans@@ wer@@ ed in the aff@@ ir@@ ma@@ tive the question that from NP CC NP they are JJ S .
NP VP but NP VP .
UH , IN NP , NP VP , so NP VP .
for NP SBAR , CD IN NP gets NP PP -- IN NP .
NP PP VBN NP S .
and then -- CD NNS later NP VP we went RB IN NP VP .
let NP NP .
and WRB NP VP , it VBZ PP and VBZ NP .
DT JJ NML NN VBZ NP .
and DT NN after DT NN , his tumor grew RB IN NP .
i am NP , NP .
and i fir@@ m@@ ly believe that IN NP NP VP MD VP .
and you can notice NP VP .
DT NN VBZ NP .
we had NP , NP , NP IN SBAR .
and it &apos;s NP PP IN NP .
and they have du@@ b@@ bed this water as NP VP .
NP , NP , IN NP EX VBZ NP .
DT NNS CC NNS VBP ADJP .
it doesn &apos; t matter if NP VP .
and they &apos;re invest@@ ing in NP , NP .
south africa is VBG NP .
how do you get IN NP IN NP ?
and then something happened IN NP .
VB .
but i think NP VP .
instead of VP , they instead went and reach@@ ed RP IN NP .
right ? so they can go online and contribu@@ te ideas on what that region would look like IN NP .
so what should we do IN NP ?
VP NP ADJP .
INTJ , NP VP -- NP VP . &quot;
they called NP ADJP S .
we had NP PP IN NP .
the world NP VP ?
soft power is NP VP .
but sometimes it just sat RB .
farmers now , who used to have to spend half a day of back@@ breaking labor to find out if the market town was open , if NP VP , whether NP VP could be sold , what price they &apos;d fe@@ tch .
they had to sus@@ p@@ end NNS IN NP .
and IN NP .
it &apos;s NP PP , VP .
tra@@ ch@@ om@@ a is NP PP IN IN NP .
and another key thing WDT NP VP google named me as NP PP .
so probably it doesn &apos; t matter 50 years from now -- stre@@ p@@ to@@ co@@ c@@ c@@ us and stuff like that will be ra@@ mp@@ ant -- because we won &apos; t be here . but if we are -- we &apos;re going to need something to do IN NP .
NN VBN !
there NNS NN RB JJ IN NP .
it &apos;s important that NP VP , and that NP RB VP .
and he liked to do an exercise with his students where he got them to take NP PP and draw NP SBAR as quickly as they could .
maybe have NP PP .
VBP NP . all right .
RB PRP VBP NP . NP VP , PRP VBP .
yeah , thought so . so we &apos;ve NP VP , haven &apos; t we ?
great . cool . so i was really interested IN NP .
RB PRP VBD NP .
NN NN -- NP VP .
and of course , by DT NN you get to NP , NP . it &apos;s pretty bar@@ ren .
NP VP , and NP VP .
IN ADJP , PRP VBP NP S .
RB IN NP PRP VBP S .
reach@@ ing success , i was pretty good at coming RP IN NP .
so they took NP CC NP IN NP .
TO VP , i wanted VP .
i had learned VP .
this is NP PP .
and i had the same reaction NP VP .
VP and NP VP .
NP VP , SBAR , NP VP .
this here is nis@@ san &apos;s my@@ lea@@ f , where your driving behavior is compared with the driving behavior of other people , so you can compe@@ te for who dri@@ ves around NP NP effici@@ ently .
they want NP VP .
and NP VP richard bu@@ chan@@ an ni@@ c@@ ely put IN NP WHADVP S . &quot;
workers are treated as well or as b@@ ad@@ ly as the workers were treated who VBD NP . &quot;
IN NP , PRP VBP NP PP .
and i like NP PP .
RB WP VBP NP VP ?
so , DT JJ NN IN NP . and if NP VP DT NN , S , played RP IN NP .
i hope RB NP NP NP RB RB .
it just looks like a sa@@ dd@@ le NP VP .
in biological systems it &apos;s important not to have NP PP for building it .
the first peak , obviously , is NP VP .
and these animals may very well be making NP PP . and they might actually be making NP PP IN NP .
biolog@@ ist sh@@ ei@@ la pat@@ ek talks about NP VP of DT NN NN , CD IN NP , using NN NNS recor@@ ding IN NP .
it turns out that NP VP .
now , go IN NP .
NP VP and NP VP .
i come RB RB , not IN NP .
so anybody who wants to VB NP and VB CC VB NP , go for it .
NP VP , but NP VP .
what is NP , NP VP ?
and the answer is : RB RB , NP VP .
we had to get rid IN NP .
and eventually s@@ now made NP PP .
so that IN NP , we &apos;re going TO VP .
so , CD NNS later , i went IN NP , and i started VP , VP . that &apos;s WP NP VP .
this is NP PP .
so it was NP PP . he sta@@ yed RP DT NN IN NP , VP .
and just this last year we &apos;ve taken NP PP IN , and this has VBN NP .
and ADVP , NP VP and SBAR , NP VP , and ADVP VP .
and then NP VP it &apos;s RB NP ADJP .
and then there &apos;s a part of the universe NP VP .
PRP VP CC VP .
and so now we &apos;re in IN NP .
so we &apos;re VP .
ADVP NP VP , ADJP ?
that pul@@ ls IN NP and pul@@ ls IN NP .
at serious play 2008 , astro@@ physi@@ c@@ ist george smo@@ ot shows stun@@ ning new images from deep - space sur@@ ve@@ ys , and pro@@ ds us to pon@@ der how the co@@ smo@@ s -- with its giant we@@ bs of NP CC NP -- got built this way .
NP VP , PRP VBP NP .
PRP VBP NP . PRP VBP NP S .
it does VB . and we rein@@ force NP , NP ?
and he actually took one look at my squ@@ ig@@ g@@ ly line , and said , &quot; well , why VB NP you just embra@@ ce the sha@@ ke ? &quot;
what if i could only create with NP VP ?
PRP VBD RB VP .
RB PRP VBD VP .
and when i made PRP$ NN IN NP i &apos;d S , NP VP , and NP VP .
i have a deeper connection to NP PP .
PRP VBP NP .
parents text and do email IN NP and IN NP while NP VP &apos; full attention .
but what might feel just right for that middle - aged ex@@ ecu@@ tive can be a problem for an ad@@ oles@@ cent who needs to VB NP .
that feeling that NP VP is very important IN NP with NN .
and we are JJ .
RB WP VBP NP VP ? PRP VBP ADVP .
make NN IN NP .
let NP VP .
NP VP , DT VBZ NP . NP , CC NP VBD ADVP PP PP .
NP VP , but ADVP NP VP .
and that &apos;s not good , for a young married man to go RB IN NP .
i think NP VP . but we don NP VP .
and you can win WRB NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
IN NP , IN NP , NP PP VBZ VP .
NP , NP , NP -- NP ADVP VP .
NP ADVP VP , and NP VP .
and RB ADVP NP VP .
DT NNS RB NP ADVP NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
PRP VBD NP ADVP .
DT JJ NN , NP VP , and NP VP . &quot;
that &apos;s what happened to me when i noticed that NP VP .
NP VP -- PP , VP , VP .
these three systems are coming together , allo@@ wing NP , CC NP .
this is fu@@ el@@ ing a massive shift from WRB NP VP -- or as NP VP . &quot;
my name is NP , NP .
DT NN IN NP said , IN NP , INTJ . we can VB S . you &apos;ll VB NP PRT .
i &apos;m asking my friends from america to help with VBG NP S .
so i was IN NP IN NP .
NN : NP VP ?
systems like the ones that we were creating IN NP could exist ahead of time .
NN : NNS .
IN NP , PRP VBD NP S .
and i met juli@@ us the last week that i was living IN NP .
NP PP VP CC VP . NP VP , NN NN VBD .
this is perhaps the most primi@@ tive sh@@ an@@ ty that you can find IN NP RB IN NP .
it &apos;s IN NP .
one is people need a guar@@ an@@ tee NP VP .
the future of these communities is in the people and in our ability to work IN NP .
i don NP VP .
VB NP ADVP ?
NP SBAR VBD NP .
many web@@ sites we can &apos; NP VP .
i think NP VP .
interest@@ ingly enough , other neuro@@ lo@@ gic diseases which affect NP PP also show tan@@ gles of NP , SBAR , and might be used VP .
i &apos;m going to VB NP cau@@ tions and make one very specific for@@ ec@@ ast .
ADVP NP VP , and ADVP NP VP .
and to make NP ADJP , let NP VP .
and if you find yourself worried that something like DT JJ NN is going VP , you might be interested to know that NP VP .
NP CC NP VBP VP .
i have become more and more un@@ comfortable with this perception of NN IN NP .
some have conclu@@ ded that NP VP .
SBAR , VP and NP VP . &quot;
so who is NN , IN RB NP CC NP ?
what if god is IN NP ?
how could PRP VB NP ?
and so , i want to kind of go IN NP .
and if NP VP , we find RP NP PP IN NP , and this is NP PP .
it was RB RB , IN NP , IN NP , IN NP .
while this is something that comes IN NP , it also has its roots deeply into the co@@ smo@@ s .
it &apos;s DT NN RP IN NP .
i think NP ADVP VP .
that &apos;s what we get from NN all the time . that &apos;s why NNS VP CC VP , is because NP VP .
mean@@ while , i had grown up around NP PP .
ADVP NP VP , PP NP VP and NP VP .
NP VP -- NP VP .
and we found PRP ADVP DT NN IN NP .
the key thing is , even if NP ADVP VP , on NP CC NP , is VBG S .
NP VP , and NP VP .
and so then they &apos;re NP VP . this is IN NP .
they didn NP VP .
so this is NP PP .
anyway . so i &apos;m going VP .
DT NNS VBP NP . DT NNS VBP NP .
NP VP , NP VP , and S CC S .
this is where we conc@@ ei@@ ve IN NP IN NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
za@@ in@@ ab sal@@ bi : NP , NP and NP PP
and she has NP , VP . &quot;
NP-TMP , NP VP , NP , NP .
and she &apos;s very important IN NP , because NP VP .
RB if NP VP , it &apos;s ADVP VP .
and when you &apos;re VBD NP , you feel kind of weird .
RB , NP VP , and NP VP . and NP VP , and NP VP .
it &apos;s NP ADJP , NP NP ?
this book i wrote because NP VP .
CC NP VP , and NP VP , i think .
environmental challenges fall IN NP , and JJS IN SBAR are JJ JJ NNS : NN NN , NN NN , ha@@ zar@@ d@@ ous waste du@@ mp@@ s . but there are RB JJ JJ NNS , IN NP IN NP IN NP , and IN NP IN NP , and IN NP IN NP IN NP .
you all know that . at the last i@@ p@@ c@@ c sum@@ mary , the scientists wanted to say , &quot; WRB NP VP ? &quot; they wanted to VB NP . &quot;
NP VP , DT VBZ NP .
what we need is another hero generation . those of us who are alive in NP PP especially , but also DT NN IN NP , have to somehow understand that NP VP -- just as NP VP .
so they &apos;re saying the right things and they may -- whi@@ che@@ ver of them is ele@@ cted -- may do DT JJ NN , but let NP VP : when i came RB PP IN NP , IN NP , only one out of 100 sen@@ ators was willing to vote TO VP , to ra@@ ti@@ fy that treat@@ y . whatever the can@@ di@@ dat@@ es say has to be la@@ id al@@ on@@ g@@ side WP NP VP .
DT NN IN NP . DT JJ NN IN NP .
and this exhi@@ bi@@ tion is IN NP , and ADVP IN NP . and one last thing is that NP VP .
he &apos;s thinking -- of course it &apos;s all a concept -- of inje@@ cting ty@@ pe@@ faces into sper@@ ma@@ to@@ zo@@ a , i don &apos; t know how to say it in english -- sper@@ ma@@ ta@@ zo@@ i -- in order to make NP VP -- to almost have a song or a whole po@@ em written with every e@@ jac@@ u@@ lation .
in this particular case a section will be de@@ vot@@ ed IN NP .
ra@@ pid manufacturing is NP VP .
another shape is made IN NP .
and many designers have been working recently on the idea of death and m@@ our@@ ning , and what we can do IN NP NN IN NP .
we did PRP IN NP .
and the same pattern emer@@ ged IN NP .
so what &apos;s VP ?
DT JJ VBD .
and within NP , NP , we have NP , SBAR .
and then god looked IN NP and realized , IN S , NP SBAR .
and that unity is something that conne@@ cts NP PP .
and he rus@@ hed home . and after the s@@ ab@@ bat@@ h , he made NP PP , took PRP IN NP , went IN NP , opened DT NN and said , NP , S , CC S . &quot;
and he called NP PP IN NP .
NP VP , and SBAR , NP VP .
but the worst part was , not the spon@@ tane@@ ous pain that was RB NP NP .
we treat NP PP IN NP .
if NP VP and NP VP , you &apos;re probably familiar IN NP .
so it &apos;s IN NP IN , NP JJ .
let me note that NP VP . they &apos;re very rare .
now the good news is that NP PP VBP NP , so i personally am not lying a@@ wake IN NP at all .
and there are DT NN IN NP . it &apos;s very hard TO VP .
this probe actually can VB NP .
so i thought that NP VP .
and we all had NP PP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
NP VP -- NP VP ; NP VP -- but NP VP .
RB RB IN NP .
PRP VBZ CC VBZ NP . NP VP , NP VP , and NP VP .
because when you think about NP , NP -- this last s@@ ession we had about africa and his hypo@@ the@@ tical 50 billion dollars dest@@ ined for africa .
now we do da@@ y@@ dre@@ aming IN NP IN NP .
what happens to NN if NP VP ?
and suppose NP VP , NP VP , and RB RB .
and in NP PP , they of course are .
PRP VBZ NP .
now , here is NP SBAR .
it &apos;s NP PP .
RB , PRP VBP NP .
WRB JJ IN NP .
so then he surprised DT NN IN NP IN NP .
but even in his wil@@ dest dreams , lincol@@ n could never have imag@@ ined WRB RB NP VP .
but it was not VP .
NP , NP , NP , NP IN NP .
one of his favorite stories , for example , had to do with NP , NP .
and i was so excited -- first person NP VP .
NP ADVP , NP : PP !
and i want to begin with one ep@@ iso@@ de from that sequence of events that most of you would be very familiar with , NP NP -- because NP VP .
and what is NP , NP VBG S ?
it was the largest em@@ pi@@ re NP VP .
no other evidence .
and equ@@ ally , he &apos;d have been surprised that NP VP .
they want to VB NP .
and i want to finish by asking you what the next story will be IN NP .
and it &apos;s only when it goes wrong that NP VP .
for DT IN NP , at age three , they &apos;re trans@@ fer@@ red PP , CC PP , IN NP . se@@ gre@@ g@@ ated PP , NP VP , often without NP SBAR .
people need to know NP , CC NP .
because NP VP .
and that &apos;s why we wanted it to be NP PP IN NP .
and just sta@@ ying in DT NN with NP VP and really em@@ power@@ ing actually .
it didn &apos; t matter if NP VP .
and i remember thinking , &quot; NP VP .
it was histor@@ ical . could it work in afghanistan with NP CC NP and NP , ADVP . , etc . , etc . ?
and NP VP , and S , CC S , NP VP , NP VP , NP VP , NP VP , NP VP , NP VP , S .
and PRP VBD NP PP .
ultimately , that &apos;s WP NP VP . &quot;
NP VP ; NP VP .
but let NP VP .
RB NP PP VBD NP S ?
compared to DT NN , we might VB NP , yes , but that &apos;s RB DT JJ NN VP , given that NP VP .
when you eat IN NP , you can &apos; NN VB NP .
and i think that NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
but CD NN , NN VBD .
NP VP , and NP VP .
PRP VBZ RB NP . &quot;
NP VP , and NP VP .
NP PP VBG NP . &quot;
i don NP VP . &quot;
but IN NP , PRP MD RB VP .
they are NP NP -- NP VP .
DT VBZ NP .
i want to VB NP NP .
PRP$ NNS , PRP$ NNS VBP .
what lessons would you take IN NP ?
and i was NN IN NP .
now , i was a little sc@@ ared because SBAR , NP VP .
and he sig@@ ns off , &quot; VBP NP . &quot;
it says NP SBAR .
can PRP VB NP ?
ADVP SBAR , NP VP , but NP VP .
wrong . i &apos;m not looking at PRP . i can &apos; NP VP .
but there exists out there DT ADJP NN IN NP WP VP , that NP VP .
she doesn NP VP .
&quot; did NP ADVP VP ? &quot; &quot; no . &quot;
now , without DT , WRB MD NP ADVP VP .
she couldn NP VP . now she says NP VP .
now folks , this is not just a metaphor NP VP , it &apos;s true .
those are RB JJ , RB JJ IN NP .
NP NP VBZ NP , S . NP VP : S , CC S .
ADVP NP VP , DT JJ NN , ADVP PP .
there has to be NP JJR . &quot;
but this gives control to the provi@@ der , whether NP VP or not , because NP VP .
but we still want to be sure that NP VP .
some lo@@ gos designed IN NP .
DT JJ NN IN NP , the creative tradition , is as po@@ tent as NP VP , if NP VP .
NP VP , and S VP .
now , there &apos;s no time VP , but the evidence is that NP PRN NP VP , it &apos;s the plants .
NP SBAR VBP NP PP .
NP NP VBP .
DT NNS IN NP are RB VBN . they are RB .
NP VP : NP PP PP .
VP -- WDT NP VP ?
and i say this as a man who has e@@ aten NP PP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
NN JJ ?
if NP VP , WRB JJ IN NP VBP NP ?
NP : NP , S S .
some of these have already been tou@@ ched IN IN NP .
5@@ 2 million people die of natural causes NP VP .
if we were to take into account future generations that will never come into NN if NP VP , then the figure becomes astronom@@ ical .
we were RB JJ .
so if you think about WP NP VP , you &apos;re actually , literally re@@ writing your own brain .
and they would just st@@ are at us with ba@@ ff@@ le@@ ment when we spend time listening IN NP , like the one we just heard -- because IN NP VP , and they would be really ir@@ ri@@ t@@ ated and wouldn &apos; t see what we were up to .
RB RB , NP VP and NP VP .
NNS : DT VBP NP , UH .
ts : yeah , well let NP VP .
and then when i did the second one , it really dist@@ ur@@ bed the piece -- these big blue lines cr@@ as@@ hing through DT NN IN NP -- and so it created a kind of NP CC NP .
NP VP , NP VP , NP ADVP ADVP VP -- NP VP .
NNS : VBP NP , NP .
NP VP , and NP VP , but PRP VBD SBAR .
i grew up in NP PP on NP PP , DT NN IN NP .
NP PP , PRP VBP NP .
i &apos;m IN NP .
NP PP VBZ NP .
WP NP VP was VP .
and so we got IN NP and made NP : NP .
and also they re@@ ference how the u@@ vul@@ a -- everything NP VP is fallen because IN NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
and you would think that should VB NP S , but i hope IN NP , you &apos;ll see NP PP .
and what changed S you might not have expected IN NP .
and if you don NP VP , you can back off and just do DT JJ things , and add pl@@ ates to NP , CC NP .
we &apos;re going to learn how to VB NP .
and i can use those patterns now to VB NP .
to@@ es have become an origami me@@ me , because NP VP .
they certainly didn NP VP .
NP SBAR VBZ NP .
for@@ rest north : DT NN IN NP starts IN NP .
he came RP IN NP . we &apos;re NN NNS .
NP VP , and NP VP . &quot;
and so they decided , because NP VP , TO VP .
but DT RB JJ JJ NN JJ RB .
and what &apos;s even more dist@@ ur@@ bing is what &apos;s happening IN NP .
and i think the reason it has NP VP , and NP VP together .
but over NP CC NP , the south korea government decided S , and so WP NP VP , they started VP .
and we have NP PP , but PRP VBZ NP , so WRB VBP NP VP ?
and the man who talked IN NP was very interesting .
and it &apos;s interesting , if NP VP .
whether NP VP , it takes NP ADJP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
SBAR NP ADVP VP and NP VP .
and if NN WRB VBP NP VP ? &quot;
and the number of us who live outside the old nation - state categ@@ ories is increasing so quickly , by 6@@ 4 million just in the last 12 years , that soon there will be JJR IN NP than NP VP .
and ADVP , NP VP , and NP VP .
and NP VP , and NP VP .
VBP NP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
and DT ADJP IN NP , NP VP , NP VP , and NP VP , we call them .
will they move IN ?
NP VP , but NP ADVP VP .
the world &apos;s population will grow IN NP IN S can we check population growth . this is the parado@@ x@@ ical answer that h@@ ans NP VP .
we are left with this missing space of increas@@ ed dea@@ ths the further north NP VP .
and NP VP , and NP VP .
ADVP , SBAR , NP VP and NP VP .
there is NP PP , IN NP .
and this is on@@ going work , but der@@ mat@@ ologists -- NP VP , PRP VBP NP .
DT VBP NP .
RB , PRP$ NN VBZ ADVP VP .
PRP VBZ NP ADVP .
and this is NP VP .
but there are other hol@@ low organs that have ad@@ ded NN IN NP .
another strategy WDT NP VP is actually TO VP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
PRP RB VBZ NP .
i would be willing to bet that NP VP because i couldn &apos; t get IN NP . i strug@@ gl@@ ed with school .
what we do is we sit and teach our kids all the things they shouldn NP VP : don &apos; t hit ; don &apos; t bi@@ te ; don &apos; t swe@@ ar .
NP PP VBD NP .
is PRP NP CC NP ? WP VBZ NP ?
and i remember this one custom@@ er so vi@@ vi@@ dly because NP ADVP VP .
NP ADVP VP , S VP , and NP VP .
and you could stuff NNS IN NP .
then i would go up and deliver them to NP VP .
that was cool because ADVP NP VP .
and then they don &apos; t have DT JJ NN , but PRP VBP NP , and NP VP , and NP VP .
if NP VP and NP VP , show them WP NP VP .
it &apos;s a video that was done IN NP that i ment@@ or .
we have even managed to make NP PP .
a har@@ ro@@ wing predi@@ le@@ ction for NP PP had become JJ , IN NP .
but structures designed VP .
the most important discovery we made IN NP IN NP was to appreci@@ ate IN S .
NP CC NP RB MD RB VP .
UH , VB ? PRP VBZ VP . PRP VBZ ADJP . RB PRP VBP .
NP VP : NP VP .
they are acting in DT NN that NP VP .
in the good old days when this republi@@ can ran that company , their greatest work was work that built on NP , NP .
now , i think there are NP , NP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
anyway , please join me in VBG NP .
if you don NP VP , you &apos;re going to VB VP .
and something else happened , NP VP .
about DT NN he was IN NP PP VBG NP .
so while NP VP and NP VP and NP VP , you think of NP PP .
VBP NP .
let NP VP .
when he met me and realized that it was possible for him to study IN NP how his design choices im@@ pac@@ ted NP PP , he got really excited , because it ad@@ ded a new dimension to what he did .
so let &apos;s just run IN NP .
NP VP , PRP VBD VP .
these are some examples of this system in NN IN NP .
and according IN NP , he &apos;s JJ NP .
IN NP , NP PP , NP INTJ , WHNP NP , WHNP SQ . &quot;
they even created an e-@@ card so NP VP .
i am NP PP .
NN VBD RB NP .
and IN NP , DT NN VBD NP .
i would like to share IN NP .
UH , PRP VBP NP .
and when you look IN NP , you get a gli@@ mp@@ se into DT NN IN NP .
voice : don &apos; t VP , or NP VP .
digital mt : this is without NP NP .
now the big question here is obviously , how do we make NP PP ?
the first is that NP VP , is the ma@@ inten@@ ance of chinese civilization .
the chinese have NP PP IN NP .
it &apos;s VBD NP .
so there we have three building blocks for trying to understand the difference that is NP , NP CC NP and its relationship to society .
first , the west is rapi@@ dly losing PRP$ NN IN NP .
now this is the way NP VP , because NN VBZ NP : china has huge numbers of NP CC NP .
red = dru@@ ms , blue = b@@ ass , JJ SYM NP , NP VP , NP VP the mou@@ th@@ piece consi@@ sts of ...
NP VP , and NP VP .
&#91; chinese &#93; &quot; JJ NN w@@ ong , &quot; was@@ h@@ burn , w@@ ong , same difference .
WP IN NP ?
everyone was gl@@ u@@ ed to the tv , watching NP VP .
SBAR , NP ADVP VP , and NP VP .
S WP VBP NP VP ? &quot;
PRP RB VBD .
then the next day , i held a meeting on NP CC NP came .
we went IN NP .
you know WP NP VP , there are so &#91; many &#93; houses inside .
IN NP PRP VBP NP .
but yesterday the city called PRP and said , NP , NP VP .
actually the fact that NP VP makes NP NP , and then en@@ ables NP VP .
and we come IN NP .
NP PP VP , VP , VP , SBAR .
NP PP VBZ NP .
ADVP NP VP , and NP VP .
super fun , and it happens IN NP .
the future , as NP VP , is very un@@ predic@@ table .
we &apos;ve seen PRP IN NP . we &apos;ve seen PRP IN NP .
but will this only be JJ PP , IN NP ? are we head@@ ed IN NP ?
an individual , for the first time in DT NN IN NP , will have the capacity , IN NP , to VB NP , to VB NP , through NP , PP , PP .
i &apos;m not on NN IN NP .
but , most importantly , while NP VP , i taught NP VP , and in NN , i learned WHADVP S .
i was h@@ es@@ it@@ ant to inclu@@ de this in PRP$ NN because NP VP .
everything had TO VP . the next painting was even bigger .
this is NP , NP .
so then NP VP , &quot; nets , what do PRP VB ? &quot;
we had NP , NP , NP , we had NP , NP , NP PP .
my works also turned JJ .
NP VP and NP VP .
and i dre@@ w PRP RP IN NP .
LS : ach@@ o@@ o !
can PRP VB PRT ?
PP NP VP , and NP VP .
LS : NP , INTJ , NP .
NN : NP VP . WP MD NP VP ?
and on one particular day , DT NNS VBD VP , they were di@@ ving IN NP . and i thought NP VP .
i started see@@ king out tri@@ ath@@ le@@ tes because i found that li@@ fel@@ ong swi@@ mm@@ ers often couldn NP VP .
the head is held IN NP IN NP , IN IN S .
so i thought WRB not VB NP ? i &apos;ll VP .
and that set me on NP VP .
and so i ended up walking IN NP .
i intervie@@ wed these people because they all taught IN NP .
that &apos;s NP PP .
what i want to talk IN NP is one idea .
now not surpris@@ ingly , that VBN NP S we were onto something .
NN NN : NP PP
and NP , NP , VBZ NP .
so david , in that story , is supposed to be NP , NP ?
if you go back over the history of ancient war@@ f@@ are , you will find time and time again that sl@@ ing@@ ers were the decisi@@ ve factor against in@@ fan@@ try in one kind of NP CC NP .
and then there &apos;s this whole weird thing about how long it takes go@@ li@@ ath to re@@ act IN NP .
and that would also explain so much of what was strange IN NP that day .
and something fe@@ ster@@ ed inside PRP after NP VP .
we have millions of genes of micro@@ bes in NP VP .
and so , these studies have docum@@ ented or suggest@@ ed out of a variety of important fun@@ ctions for NP , NP , NP WHNP S .
NP VP , and NP VP .
and that &apos;s WP NP VP . so wikipedia -- you just saw NP PP -- it &apos;s DT ADJP NN . it &apos;s written IN NP RB IN NP .
and he &apos;s only been PRP$ NN IN NP , NP PP .
the media has VBN NP ADVP .
we should mer@@ ely report on what repu@@ table par@@ ties have said IN NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
RB NN VBZ , S . VP -- NP VP . &quot;
and i also like to VB NP &apos;s the only person who actually knows NP PP , so ...
NNP NNP : INTJ NP .
NP CC NP , VBP VP .
almost nobody gets out IN NP alive .
we found NP VP .
NP RB , PRP MD VP .
i &apos;ve also come to believe that NP VP .
NP VP -- VP .
so , i will close IN NP . these are my older people .
i &apos;m not RB JJ .
three : sin@@ e@@ w used IN NP .
d@@ ong wo@@ o j@@ ang : DT NN IN NP
and like PDT DT NNS IN NP , NP VP ma@@ tured IN NP .
and they use NP CONJP NP .
NP PP , IN NP , VBD ADVP NP .
the di@@ ver here has a rop@@ e to@@ y , and i &apos;m on NP PP , and i &apos;ve RB VBN NP , and that &apos;s NP PP .
DT NN NNS IN NP .
den@@ ise her@@ zing : could we speak NP PP ?
it &apos;s based on NP VP . &quot;
NN : ADVP NP VP .
so the idea was , okay , keep NP PP , but VB NP and VB NP .
because NP VP , you need VP .
so i did try VP .
with that , i have to ada@@ pt IN NP .
NN : PRP VBP NP .
i bet NP VP .
wor@@ r@@ y@@ ingly , there is NP PP .
we don NP VP .
so we percei@@ ve nothing as WP NP ADVP VP .
why NP CC NP ?
it &apos;s the basic regul@@ ating NN IN NP .
so this little slide here shows you NP VP and that VP .
i have NP PP .
NP VP , PRP VBD NP SBAR .
so , the new festi@@ val , it as@@ ks the audience to VB NP PP .
case in point : when &quot; the su@@ l@@ tan &apos;s eleph@@ ant &quot; came IN NP NP IN NP , a lon@@ don@@ er wrote , &quot; for the first time since the london bom@@ b@@ ings , my daughter called up with that spar@@ kle back in her voice .
&#91; &quot; acade@@ my a@@ ward w@@ inner for visual effects &quot; &#93; second doctor : wel@@ come to NP , NP : good .
and SBAR : NP VP -- NP VP -- but NP VP .
after NP PP , it just becomes NN .
but unfortunately , 95 percent of DT NNS IN NP are also re@@ ce@@ ding right now to DT NN that NP VP .
after an hour in these conditions , it &apos;s so extreme that , WRB NP VP , almost DT NN i v@@ om@@ it IN NP IN S .
when i &apos;m on my de@@ ath@@ bed , i &apos;m going to remember NP JJR IN NP .
NP ADVP VP -- NP VP -- NP VP , NP VP , and ADVP NP VP .
PRP VBD NP PP . PRP MD ADVP VP .
this NP JJ t happen NP PP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
now that you &apos;re done VP , close them down , because every phone has NP PP .
now , instead of doing it like mis@@ direction and thro@@ wing it off to the side , instead , what i choose to focus on is frank , to be able to play with the frank IN NP gu@@ ard , and get you , instead of foc@@ using IN NP , just to go NP PP .
do you have NP PP ? joe : PRP VBP NP .
VB NP . VBP NP ADVP .
i &apos;m going to try to push PRP IN NP .
down here i noticed this . is this something of NP , NP ?
RB VBP VP .
we did not imagine that NP VP .
could we le@@ verage these technologies to switch smar@@ tly whenever you travel IN NP IN NP ?
and the local finan@@ cing is not NN IN NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
this last project is RB IN NP .
you can actually predict WP NP-TMP NP VP , WHNP PP NP VP , and WHNP PP NP VP .
and by the matri@@ x , i mean literally the matri@@ x , like NP VP . &quot;
PRP VBZ NP NP .
i think NP VP .
notice RB that PP , NP VP .
so DT NN , these three pan@@ els portra@@ y NP SBAR .
because NP VP .
they want order , even at NP PP .
can you be not for or against NN ?
what i want to talk IN NP IN NP is some of the problems that NP SBAR .
so again , they would say , &quot; well if NP VP , if PRP VBP SBAR , we can do NN VP and know that if NP VP , we &apos;re not VBG S . &quot;
they generally seem to think , &quot; well , why would we care what &apos;s happened IN NP ?
so the next two years were the years NP VP .
PRP VBD VP .
IN NP , NP VP , and NP VP .
they &apos;re trained to be RBR JJ IN NP than NP VP .
and the question S , NP can PRP VB NP ? can it be done ? &quot;
we have NP VP .
they &apos;re a bit sub@@ ver@@ sive in WP NP VP .
and then he didn &apos; t particularly like NP SBAR .
now that could VB NP , it could be NP VP .
this is steve wo@@ z@@ ni@@ ak . where does he learn IN NP ?
and dre@@ w RB , IN NP , is not glam@@ or@@ ous either .
and DT VBZ NP .
this is NP NP .
ADVP NP VP , but NP VP .
NP VP , NP VP -- NP VP , NP VP .
so , this s@@ ession &apos;s supposed VP but glamour &apos;s really par@@ tly IN S .
it was cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed for VP , because , S , NP VP and do all these kinds of NP SBAR .
so she &apos;s even more glam@@ or@@ ous if NP VP , even though NP VP .
it was NP PP .
oh sure , sure , i had NP PP , the way an ab@@ u@@ sive par@@ ent can sometimes have DT NN IN NP .
i heard about NP SBAR because NP VP .
and the fire that bur@@ ned IN NP IN NP IN NP is the fire that VBZ VP .
NP VP , PRP VBD NP .
PRP VBD NP .
RB DT JJ NN RB VBZ ADJP .
and i@@ van puts his sandwi@@ ch over here , on NN IN NP .
which sandwi@@ ch is he going VP ?
no , because the wind should get IN NP .
now she thinks NP VP .
okay , so it causes NP PP IN S .
so , there &apos;s NP PP VP .
DT VBZ NP . NNP NNP , VBP NP ADVP . DT VBD ADJP .
and sometimes it takes NP NP , VP .
but i think if you cut through those forces , you get to what might be NP , NP .
and in this , to@@ w@@ ns begin to re@@ think how they organi@@ ze the urban landscape , so that NP VP and smell the ro@@ ses and connect with one another .
and nor@@ way , swe@@ den , den@@ mark and fin@@ land now r@@ ank IN NP IN NP , and they work NP PP .
i think NP VP .
i no longer hear NP VP .
how do you discover NP PP IN ADJP IN NP ?
and when there were NNS IN NP , i said , &quot; well , it &apos;s worth doing the island because NP VP . &quot;
and NP VP and NP VP .
and again , i felt kind of un@@ comfortable with DT NN that NP VP and that NP VP .
studies for NP PP .
so i think NP VP .
so i &apos;m going to VB NP , we &apos;re going to play RB IN NP .
well we &apos;re ja@@ zz musi@@ cians , so stere@@ ot@@ yp@@ ically NP VP .
na@@ ma@@ ste . sal@@ a@@ am .
i have come IN NP .
ADVP , NP VP , but NP VP .
it comes off DT NN here and is dra@@ wn RP IN NP .
now , the particular species of dra@@ gon@@ fly PRP VBP S is this one , because most dra@@ gon@@ flies , like NP SBAR , WRB NP VP , it doesn NP VP . it can &apos; t travel very far .
and i didn NP VP , WHADVP S .
you &apos;re RB JJ . you &apos;re RB JJ . no . hang RP . hang RP .
it stre@@ t@@ ches IN NP .
that &apos;s NP , NP WHADVP S .
the lar@@ va@@ e have VP .
and the dra@@ gon@@ flies are there . i have NNS IN NP .
and i only st@@ um@@ bled on DT because NP VP .
and they are not NP SBAR .
so , that &apos;s what i &apos;ve done IN NP .
NP VP , but NP VP ?
and NP NP ?
this one , NP JJ VP , and VP , VP .
and they &apos;re not RB JJ .
next . and NP VP , and NP VP . PRP VBD NP .
CC RB many people , NP VP , watch DT NNS .
but car@@ l norden is really the one who NP NP .
so in the years leading IN IN NP , the u.s. military bu@@ ys 9@@ 0,000 of these norden bom@@ b@@ si@@ ghts at a cost of NP NP -- again , in 19@@ 40 dollars , that &apos;s a lot of money .
well how many clou@@ d@@ less sk@@ ies do you think NP VP ?
and NP VP and VP -- VB NP ?
IN NP , NP PP VBZ VP .
and vis@@ iting NP , NP , NP RB -- i was here DT NN ago .
but that &apos;s not really DT NN NP VP .
but VBG PP , NP VP well , NP VP , we seem VP . &quot;
and DT JJ NN , IN S , is IN NP RB .
and what DT VBZ is that NP VP . it &apos;s written IN NP .
now , africa is NP PP -- about NP VP -- and RB NP PP ADVP , IN IN NP .
we became ADVP JJ . the social networks exp@@ and@@ ed .
and NP VP we &apos;ve S , NP VP , NP .
NNS IN NP -- VP , VP . , etc .
well , the answer seems to be , NP VP .
and PP , NP VP , but ADVP NP VP .
stars will create the gol@@ di@@ lo@@ cks conditions for VBG NP .
NP ADVP VP , and NP VP .
as NP NP , once IN NP , there ten@@ ds VP .
we are bl@@ essed with NP , NP that NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
and then they bl@@ ame the ban@@ ks for being the bad guys who VBD NP NP .
JJ HYPH NN people spend NP IN NP .
take out those who say NP VP .
or IN S NP , NP .
what are NP PP ?
it &apos;s very pain@@ ful , even though NP VP .
maybe we should make NP VP .
if NP VP , we need VP .
it &apos;s completely fu@@ cked up and can only be expla@@ ined IN NP .
you &apos;re RB .
VB NP .
when i go out TO VP , every day NP VP , we think too much .
CC NP VP , VBP NP , what do PRP VB S ? &quot;
RB , WRB RB VBZ NP VP ?
PRP VBP NP NP .
because she fell in love with wal@@ ter r@@ al@@ ei@@ gh , she was giving up the reasons she was a queen , and then wal@@ ter r@@ al@@ ei@@ gh fell in love with her lady in waiting , and she had to decide whether NP VP or she wanted ...
NN : NN ?
eli@@ z@@ ab@@ eth : NP VP , and NP VP .
so how do PRP VB NP ?
NP VP , and NP VP .
NP VP ; NP VP .
i met NP : NP .
we needed to be working IN NP .
this is WRB NP VP .
we need to VB NP S .
NP VP , but NP VP .
are we going to work IN NP ?
we need NP VP .
we &apos;re VBG NP we have to VB NP PP .
it &apos;s more IN ADJP again .
i am NP PP .
and i promise IN NP , NP VP , WRB NP VP .
let NP VP .
they are NP PP .
a spin@@ al cor@@ d in@@ j@@ ury can se@@ ver the communication between PRP$ NN and PRP$ NN , leading to NN . fresh from his lab , gr@@ Ã©@@ go@@ ire cour@@ t@@ ine shows a new method -- combin@@ ing NP , NP CC NP -- that could VP CC VP . see how it works , as NP VP .
i am an example of what &apos;s possible when girls from NP PP are loved and nur@@ tured IN NP .
and i think about that today because i am remin@@ ded and convinced that NP VP .
i loved VP .
because NP VP .
sum@@ mer@@ time and the living is easy NP VP and NP VP oh , your da@@ d@@ dy &apos;s rich and your ma is good - looking so S CC S , and i saw that she had NP VP .
VB NP S . VP , NN NN NN VBZ S , SBAR . NP : NP : / NP CC NP :
NP , NP responsible , sing@@ ly , for VBG NP .
instead , again , it is as if NP VP , but we can only see IN NP RB IN NP .
WRB VBD NP VP ?
i am not VBG NP PRT .
and wikipedia has VBN NP .
but then , you can see NP VP .
here is the ch@@ art of NP VP square park to another .
radical open@@ ness is still a dist@@ ant future in NP PP .
in red , sort of IN NP average .
NP ADVP VP , and NP , PP , NP VP .
NN , PRP$ JJ NN , IN NP , fe@@ at@@ u@@ red IN NP , IN NP .
it didn NP VP . it didn NP VP .
high per@@ form@@ ers on NP PP .
DT NN VBZ .
rich countries have been sending NN IN NP .
there could be NP PP . and one is cell phones .
so i started looking IN NP IN -- does connec@@ tivity really increase produ@@ c@@ tivity ?
and NP PP VBZ NP .
and RB , VP -- ADVP NP VP . &quot;
RB , IN NP PRP VBD PP .
ADJP NNS VBP NP . &quot;
PP NP VP and ADVP NP VP .
CD IN NP was NP PP IN NP .
but really , really natural so@@ ver@@ eig@@ n@@ ty was good IN NP .
this is the great lea@@ p forward , WRB NP VP .
you see NP PP , IN NP .
i will show NP PP IN NP RB , poor down here , rich up there .
but the real proje@@ ctions for those ones , i would like to give PRP IN NP .
for NP PP , i &apos;ve VBN VP .
IN NP , NP CC NP VBZ S .
now , how do we de@@ du@@ ce WRB NP VP ?
PRP VBP NP .
and also , you can tell IN NP , by VP , that NP VP .
NP , ADJP , IN NP , was IN S .
one or both , WP VP ? or it could VB NP .
we discovered NN NP IN , and we fell IN NP IN NP . we hope NP VP .
and what was RB JJ PP was that IN S , NP VP -- NP VP .
they squ@@ ir@@ t PRP IN NP .
if PRP VBP NP , you probably know that NP VP .
we didn NP VP .
so one way to test to see whether NP VP is to look and see is there more behavior change in areas where there &apos;s less malaria .
it &apos;s not the only place NP VP .
but since NP VP , we can RB VB NP PP .
and hiv is actually particularly RB VBN IN NP .
their ex@@ por@@ ts went down DT NN IN NP -- and actually that dec@@ line lines up ADVP IN NP .
if i could reve@@ al anything that VBZ VP , it would be to reve@@ al something WDT NP VP , that NP VP as well as NP VP .
and NP VP and NP VP .
ADVP NP VP , NNS VBP NP S . &quot;
and those bu@@ mp@@ s act IN NP .
and then we wonder why the mem@@ bran@@ e clo@@ gs and WRB NP VP .
em@@ bed@@ ding nan@@ op@@ artic@@ les in DT NN IN NP , always .
at NP , SBAR , we work IN NP .
and hopefully , with their help , we &apos;ll learn how to live IN NP , and IN NP , but not ours alone .
i go , VP ? &quot;
they bel@@ on@@ ged IN NP .
if NP ADVP ADJP , they &apos;re PRP$ NN . learn IN NP .
WP NP VP , if NP VP . &quot;
NP VP , NP VBP NP VP ? &quot;
i want to VB NP NP .
and you see , NP VP . there was no time VP .
NN : JJ NN ! NP VP , and NP VP . &quot;
so let NP VP .
and basically , since NP VP , DT NN IN NP have VBN S .
VP and NP VP .
okay , that &apos;s NN NN .
so i &apos;ll just let NP VP .
so i don &apos; t even know if NP VP .
people really can learn DT NN IN NP .
DT VBZ NP .
instead of VP , we invest IN NP .
NP , NP VBZ PP .
so this was a trick to VB NP .
and i can VB NP NP .
we live longer . we have access to technology that would have seemed IN NP NP IN .
maybe these people are right . maybe mind - wandering VBZ NP .
a few minutes ago , i li@@ ken@@ ed mind - wandering to a s@@ lot machine NP VP .
and PP , NP VP , and NP VP .
NP VP , NP-TMP , NP VP and NP VP .
ADVP SBAR , NP VP , and NP VP .
now i have learned that my place is not just IN NP or IN NP , and i &apos;m still se@@ arch@@ ing for my identity , but i saw ghana create democracy better .
so i &apos;m going VP , and what exactly is it that NP VP .
so therefore the church said that NP VP , you know .
DT JJ NN IN NP was not IN NP .
and , S , NP PP VBZ NP PP .
i was thinking about VBG NP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
but that ... process is WP NP VP -- sometimes you do that , if NP VP , you want VP .
they made all kinds of -- and then finally one giant bom@@ b to end NP , NP ?
but NP ADVP VP , ADJP ?
NP VP , SBAR , NP VP ?
and in grad school i became interested in creatures that d@@ well IN NP .
WRB NP VP , it also felt IN NP .
it must have been NP PP .
NP VP and PP , NP VP .
and this is the first theater project NP VP .
and if NP VP , just scri@@ b@@ ble DT NN .
and when we VBD NP NP , and VBD , &quot; can you do it ? &quot; they couldn NP VP . right ?
IN NP and RB , right , they &apos;ve S ? NP VP , NP VP , and NP VP , and PRP VBP NP , PP , PP .
ADVP , NP VP , ADJP ?
now -- oh , oh yeah , VP , VP .
so when i thought IN NP , RB suddenly i realized that NN VBD NP NP .
so as a chem@@ ist , i wanted to VP , VP . what is going on here ?
NP VP ; NP VP ; NP VP ; NP VP .
ADVP NP VP UH , or NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
if NP VP , forget DT JJ NN .
you &apos;re sitting IN NP .
because NP VP , if NP VP , there &apos;s NP SBAR .
and i will take NN IN NP .
VP , ADVP NP VP , and NP VP .
so what PRP VBP S is that NP VP .
here we have VBN NP .
my ancestors moved IN NP .
RB PRP VBP NP .
and VP , DT JJ JJ NNS RB VBP VP .
that is , when PRP VBP NP , we &apos;ll get DT NN NP RB , WHNP S .
and if NP VP , then , of NN , the conditions improve , and they start VP .
of course , as soon as you say something like NP VP it is impossible , and that &apos;s what was said IN NP .
broke NP PP IN NP .
and NN VBD , PRN , NP .
you have to design DT JJ NN IN NP .
we &apos;ve talked about NN and NP PP , let NP VP .
you know something ? this has been achie@@ ved IN NP .
sorry , it doesn &apos; t work . you have to VB NP PP , NP .
ladies and gentle@@ men , i &apos;d like to end IN NP .
when NP VP , PP NP VP , and NP VP , &quot; ma@@ shel@@ k@@ ar , like this , if PRP VBP RB VP , if PRP VBP NP , you can achieve NN IN NP . &quot;
i &apos;d like to share DT NN IN NP NN .
so we &apos;re getting NN IN NP VP .
and i realized that NP VP .
and the reason NP VP is S .
NP , INTJ NP VP -- S , NP VP â but NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
so , we moved IN NP IN NP .
ADVP VP NP : NP VP .
VP -- and NP VP . &quot;
NP VP : SBAR , NP VP ; SBAR , NP VP .
NP , VP , VBZ NP ?
let me sum@@ mar@@ ize it , for NP PP , with NP , NP .
i was also very interested in perhaps going IN NP and becoming DT NN , because it meant working IN NP IN NP .
that &apos;s IN NP .
ADVP , NP VP , but NP VP .
but i had NP PP .
and your entire body , NN -- NP , NP , NP , NP -- everything is made of NN .
DT NN IN NP : WRB VBP NP VP ?
image - NP NP , VBG NP PP .
because NP VP , you are DT NN IN S .
and PRP VBP NP .
this was considered as JJ NN that NP VP .
and this is related IN NP .
it &apos;s RB JJ . it &apos;s RB JJ .
there can be NP VP .
and i thought , &quot; well , what VBZ NP ? &quot;
and i VBP NP , NP S , NP S , VP . &quot;
NP NP VP : NP VP ; NP ADVP VP .
so what i did is i took DT IN NP WRB NP VP .
they thought NP VP .
and she said , &quot; what VBZ NP ? &quot;
no .
and then we are mis@@ er@@ able , and we are looking IN NP , and then we feel vulnerable , so then we have a couple of NP CC NP .
and when you hold DT JJ JJ NNS IN NP , NP VP , &quot; NN IN NP , she &apos;s perfect .
after going IN NP IN NP .
and ni@@ ke knows how to VB NP PP .
JJ NN : DT VBN NN
RB , NP PP , NP VP , but NP VP .
those are things that are different IN NP .
DT JJ , DT JJ .
years after he &apos;s VP , i learned that NP SBAR , VBG NP , were VBG NP S .
so , this is what happened WRB NP VP .
S WRB VBP NP VP ? &quot;
even the ones that believed NP VP mat@@ ched the contro@@ ls exactly . exactly .
NP VP , NP VP , NP VP , NP VP .
NP IN NP , NP PP VBD .
VP , IN NP , VBZ NP .
S , NP MD NP VP ? &quot;
it &apos;s RB JJ .
RB , DT NN VBZ INTJ .
RB if NP VP , you just focus IN NP .
i think NP VP .
so this means that , with DT NN he invest@@ ed , he was able to move NP PP IN NP .
we hope to have opened DT NN IN NP , so NP VP .
if NP VP , there &apos;s NP , NP CC NP .
so we can study DT IN NP .
these are NP VP .
these are NP VP .
now that was che@@ ating , because NP VP .
ADVP IN S , ADVP NP VP or NP VP .
RB , NP SBAR VBD NP .
th@@ ur@@ s@@ day night is VB NP .
you &apos;re ADVP IN NP .
this was WRB NP VP .
and SBAR , NP VP ; NP VP .
i didn NP ADVP VP . and paul rand was NP PRN NP -- RB RB IN NP ?
PRP VBZ ADVP . PRP VBZ NP .
on DT NN , WRB NP VP , that ar@@ row moves RB .
he went IN NP .
NP VP , so NP VP .
this i found , where nature had made NP PP .
and so i realized NP VP .
but , IN NP , NP VP , and NP VP .
NN NNS VBP RB NP .
i want to write IN NP and ru@@ ins all the fur@@ ni@@ ture and kill@@ s everybody . &quot;
we have a serious com@@ pres@@ sion of NP VP .
NP PP VBP ADVP NP .
they &apos;re nervous IN NP .
NP VP , PRP VBP S .
is this a problem ? yes , it &apos;s NP NP .
more than how a phenomenon works , theore@@ tical physi@@ ci@@ sts are always interested in why a phenomenon works in the way NP VP .
PRP VBP NP , and NP VP , and SBAR VP .
so the challenge was to try and get them to do what we wanted them to do by listening IN NP , and creating NP SBAR .
NP VP , but VP .
NP VP , EX VBZ NP .
RB VBP NP ADVP .
NP VP , NP VP , or NP VP .
but we NP RB VP know IN NP , but i really enjoy VP .
RB , NP VP , and NP VP .
and our test pilot gave us the best feedback NP VP . &quot;
RB VP CC VP .
now , here is NP SBAR .
so he tried NN NN .
NP NP : PP , NP VP .
there is a basic view that NP VP , invol@@ ves labor . it invol@@ ves engineering .
it ta@@ stes great IN NP , but absolute shi@@ te if NP VP .
NN : NP NP .
we need to VP VP .
it took PRP NP NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
PRP VBP NP ?
NP VP , but ADVP NP VP .
a me@@ me is not equivalent IN NP .
NNP : NN ?
from the moment that NP , NP , VBD S , there was a new cop@@ ying process .
and we &apos;re VP .
DT NN IN NP .
do you know , sitting here , your brain is using NP PP IN NP ?
and why would PRP VB NP ?
it was 25 minutes of absolute ter@@ ror that NP PP .
there is nothing here that we don NP VP .
PP VP NP , NP VP .
this is not RB IN NP , IN NP .
and NP VP , and NP VP .
we paid them 10 cents per NP , NP , NP , NP , NP .
RB , NP VP , so NP VP ? &quot;
but this did not solve the big problem NP VP a social element .
all of NP VP were car@@ ne@@ gie m@@ ell@@ on students .
more generally , i want to VB NP NP .
but if i was to say that they &apos;re NP PP or NP PP in NP , NP , you &apos;d probably think i was a little bit bon@@ kers .
&quot; JJ S . &quot; &quot; bar@@ cla@@ ys takes PRP IN NP . &quot;
ADVP NP VP , but NP VP , you look IN NP .
and we did a survey that bac@@ ks up the fact that , you know , CD NN IN NP demo@@ graphic IN NP .
and WDT NP VP i look IN NP IN NP .
it &apos;s easy VP .
because after about six months of me talking IN NP , i think he finally figured out that NP VP .
so something interesting had VP .
not RB about NP CC NP , but up here in NP PP .
and NP VP , ADVP VP .
NN : RB ADVP , NP VP , so NP VP .
NN : RB ADJP .
ADVP NP VP , and NP VP .
as NP VP and NP VP , this early a@@ we with DT NNS has only intensi@@ fied .
the people who are attra@@ cted IN NP typically have a ha@@ cker ment@@ ality .
so with DT , i &apos;d like VP , but it shares NP , NP , CC NP , and we do PRP IN NP IN S .
it basically means VP .
it would be great if NP VP .
WRB VBZ NP VP ?
this is IN NP .
of course , they &apos;re NP VP .
markets have changed beyond NP PP , but only for NP PP .
NNS IN NP ?
and NP VP , and NP VP .
ADVP NP VP , but NP VP .
IN NP , EX VBP NP .
gas , i &apos;m probably the only person who really enjo@@ ys it WRB NP VP , because NP VP .
but small atoms want to join together , small nu@@ cle@@ i want to join together to make bigger ones to go IN NP .
but fortunately , if you can VB NP , you &apos;ve VP , so you can make NP VP .
and RB IN NP , DT VBZ NP .
i wish S , i wish NP VP .
but IN NP VBD DT ADJP NN .
the sig@@ ns don NP VP , some have said .
NP , CC NP , VBP NP .
what DT VBZ is that NP VP .
we &apos;ve RB VBN NP .
because NP VP ADVP VP and NNS .
SBAR VP -- NP VP . ADVP NP VP , and NP VP .
NP , NP , VBD , &quot; air@@ planes VBP NP , but PP . &quot;
and it &apos;s poin@@ ted IN NP .
many prototyp@@ es cr@@ as@@ hed -- JJ .
IN NP IN NP .
it allows NP VP .
NN VP VP .
yeah , it also went IN NP .
DT NNS IN NP tried NP , NP .
i work IN NP .
and there is NP , CC NP .
DT NN VBD NP PP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
WRB NP VP , someone VBD NP PP and VBD NP , VBD NP S .
i tell kids WRB NP VP , it really helps to VP CC VP .
now i remember , WRB NP VP , NP VP .
WP VP is NN , and at NP PP , DT NN IN NP starts VP .
PRP VBZ NP .
UH , NP VP , and NP VP . &quot;
the self &apos;s NP VP .
and if NP VP , incredible things happen .
and DT VBD NP .
so it &apos;s VBD NP .
and so we spent time travel@@ ing with them and learning about all the different elements , and finding that there were pl@@ ent@@ y of in@@ effici@@ en@@ cies that weren NP VP .
so there are up IN NP ADVP everyday .
IN NP , PRP VBD NP .
the british government -- any government is poten@@ tially the worst cli@@ ent in the world NP VP .
VBP NP .
CD IN NP , IN NP , is NP PP .
but IN S , ADVP NP VP , and PP , NP VP .
UH , ADVP NP VP , NP VP , and NP VP .
IN NP , NP PP VP , VP .
well , the argument in NP NP was that NP , SBAR , VP .
wrong . iden@@ tical tw@@ ins , or any si@@ bl@@ ings , who VBP VP are no less similar than if NP VP .
S CC S , NP VP , can PRP VB NP NP ? &quot;
and i &apos;m like NP VP , you know .
and i said , NP INTJ NP .
NP VP , NP ADVP ADVP . &quot;
NP VP ; NP VP .
i can still see NP VP .
NP VP VBD NP VP ? &quot;
un@@ speak@@ ably dangerous .
PRP VBP NP NP-TMP .
PRP VBD NP .
i &apos;ve VBD NP .
but he fa@@ ked it too well , and now he &apos;s stuck in NN and nobody will believe NP VP .
fa@@ ke ma@@ dness .
it &apos;s RB JJ . &quot;
and his clin@@ i@@ cian said to me , &quot; if you want VP , you can go on NP VP . &quot;
can i come and interview PRP IN NP ? &quot;
and NP VP , and NP VP . &quot;
and we stit@@ ch them together INTJ NP .
anyway , that was NP IN , and IN NP WRB NP VP .
let NP VP .
NP VP , or NP VP , but EX VBZ NP .
and NP VP and NP VP .
because NP VP .
and it is JJ -- NP VP -- for NP SBAR .
now at the time , i was working IN NP .
and colle@@ c@@ tively , we really didn NP VP .
but an interesting thing was not@@ ed IN NP .
and they could be extin@@ ct IN NP , if NP VP .
NP , NP , NP NP , and ADVP PP .
so , back IN NP .
so we got some land that was don@@ ated IN NP .
WHNP S , PP , NP VP , and ADVP , NP VP -- NP VP , NP NP ? PRP VBP , NP .
and i &apos;m also rather surprised , because when i look back on PRP$ NN the last thing NP ADVP VP was write , or be in NP VP .
RB if NP VP , what is PRP RB ?
and this struggle VP is NP PP .
tell PRP WHADVP S . let NP VP . &quot;
it &apos;s what is meant by over@@ coming the hor@@ ror WDT NP VP , and beginning to VB NP .
as NP VP , here is DT JJ NN .
so this little ant WDT VP , it &apos;s like NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
RB , NP VP , ADVP NP VP , and NP VP .
it was NP PP .
the design comes IN NP .
NN IN NP , apart IN NP , hasn &apos; t moved IN ADJP IN NP VP .
and WRB NP VP , i &apos;m IN NP .
and that &apos;s WHADVP S . it &apos;s RB NP , NP .
but NP VP , but NP VP .
and i think NP VP .
but i also don NP VP .
but NP , NP , VP CC VP .
now i know NP VP .
NP-TMP NP VP , PRP VBP NP PP .
VB NP . PRP VBZ NP .
ADVP NP VP ; NP VP .
and i say to tony , &quot; let NP VP . &quot;
NP VP , and NP VP . &quot;
and DT VBZ VP .
so you start really understanding that you can have NP , NP , NP , CC NP , i &apos;ve looked at from the vie@@ w@@ point of food .
we &apos;ve spent NP PP VP .
NP VP , and NP , ADVP , NP VP .
it found that NP VP .
now , it just shouldn NP VP .
i see NP , VP .
PRP VBP NP . PRP VBP NP .
i loved when he was talking IN NP .
PRP VBZ NP .
not running IN NP , but enter@@ ing NN , sur@@ ren@@ der@@ ing to NN .
because WHADVP S , NP VP , or NP VP .
now i was stupid , but not so stupid that NP VP .
NP CC NP , NP PP .
PRP VBD ADVP VP . &quot;
NP VP , PRP VP , VP CC VP . pre@@ st@@ o !
seriously .
not RB j@@ ack@@ ie coll@@ ins .
like my wish that NP VP or that NP VP .
we love NNS , but WRB NP VP , trust NP , NP VP .
and in case you don NP VP .
when PRP VBD S , the typical metho@@ ds of NN were limited IN NP IN NP RB , IN NP IN NP .
RB , PRP$ NNS VBP NP NP .
this is probably the sa@@ d@@ dest sound NP VP .
the school teachers weren &apos; t VBG NP , the spor@@ ts were very dir@@ ty or very pain@@ ful .
but of course the scientists couldn NP VP .
RB RB VBZ NP NP SBAR .
so as far as NN IN NP , what do you think NP VP ?
and once we get ADVP , NP VP , or NP ADVP VP .
i &apos;m addi@@ cted , because even though i know NP VP , i still cra@@ ve more .
no butt@@ ons to VB , no tri@@ g@@ gers to pull , NP CC NP .
but maybe NP NP RB JJ .
as far as NP VP , there &apos;s RB CD colle@@ ges around NP VP .
VBP NP .
somehow we have to understand NP VP .
ADVP NP VP , but PP NP VP .
and the mathemati@@ cians and scientists in the crowd will recognize NP PP and NP , VP .
so if you look IN NP RB , the speed is always going TO VP .
and they say , VP . const@@ ant acceler@@ ation .
the future of NN , where NP : CC S . i don NP VP .
now i know there &apos;s been NP PP IN NP .
it will RB VB NP NP .
and it is really not su@@ ited IN NP .
there are NP PP .
humanity is going VP .
the one thing though NP VP , is that NP VP .
and RB WP VP NP ? new life .
JJ NN : S VP
it &apos;s our own pon@@ d . and that &apos;s WRB NP VP . &quot;
NP , SBAR , VBP SBAR ? NP VP , NP INTJ . &quot;
and then she goes , &quot; mom , do you think NP VP , on NP , NP ? &quot;
so the possibility exists IN ADVP RB VB NP .
once you &apos;ve VBN NP , the instal@@ lation &apos;s quite easy .
and as NP VP , there VBP RB ADVP NP ADVP , NP CC NP , but also there are NP PP .
i &apos;m sure NP VP .
they simply want to do WDT NP VP .
and as a result , it &apos;s NP PP and NP PP .
DT VBZ NP .
NP VP ; NP VP .
PRP VBP NP .
and i went to VB NP .
and i didn NP VP .
VBP NP .
if NP VP , you &apos;re RB IN NP .
we are right now in the beautiful ore@@ o of NN -- of NP PP -- following the first horri@@ ble micro@@ bi@@ al age .
and the black rock is NP PP .
DT VBP NP .
the survi@@ vor@@ s that do get IN NP NP PP .
it can only occu@@ r if NP VP -- enough , for NN , TO VP .
it &apos;s been on this planet since the animals first started -- NP .
now , the same mouse is VBN NP , and VP .
am i understanding you right , that what you &apos;re saying here is that we have in our own bodies a bio@@ chemical response to hydro@@ gen su@@ l@@ fi@@ de that in your mind pro@@ ves that NP VP ?
NP VP and NP ADVP VP .
and their factory in china -- which probably is pretty clean -- is getting all of the ingre@@ di@@ ents from back@@ y@@ ard ab@@ at@@ to@@ irs , where families VBP NP and VB NP .
their vot@@ ers are JJ .
even if NP VP , and NP VP , the fine would be JJ .
NP VP , but NP ADVP VP .
there are NP PP . &quot;
join PRP , come IN NP , and let NP VP .
you will VB NP PP .
RB PRP VBP NP S .
now i can VB NP PP .
and then someone else has NP NP .
it &apos;s not that NP VP .
and i always thought that NP VP , but NP VP .
it &apos;s what i stri@@ ve for NP : NP .
i was NP , NP , CC NP .
but i was driven by an in@@ her@@ ent sense that a picture that reve@@ aled NP PP would almost by definition be an anti-@@ war photograph .
one of the things i had to learn IN NP was what to do with my an@@ ger .
this man had just been liber@@ ated IN NP .
i spent NP PP IN NP .
an m@@ s@@ f hospital in NP PP .
this is NP VP .
whenever NP VP , NP VP , NP VP , or NP VP , cha@@ ds are left VP .
and there &apos;s some complicated cr@@ yp@@ to@@ graph@@ y going on in there , but what &apos;s not complicated is vot@@ ing IN NP .
david bis@@ mark demo@@ s NP PP .
but that sub@@ divi@@ des NN , NN CC NN IN NP .
but there was also many chri@@ stian countries that had NP PP .
but there are RB NNS RB PP , IN NP , IN NP .
ADVP NP VP , and ADVP NP VP .
and the world population will VB NP .
and ADVP ADVP NP VP and NP VP .
i wo@@ und RP IN NP .
we dec@@ lar@@ ed NP VP .
but in DT NN , small@@ po@@ x explo@@ ded IN NP .
we failed CD JJ NNS .
this year , that NP VP , india .
within three weeks it will be RB IN NP .
but IN NP , NP VP , and NP VP . &quot;
but they were able to point to who and let them know that NP VP .
the first number is NP : NP .
we know from asking NNS IN NP IN NP .
you &apos;ll change your smar@@ t@@ phone seven or eight times , probably more if NP VP .
actually , we found 100 percent is easier to do than NP CC NP .
DT NN VBZ ADJP .
and we do not want to VB NP .
there was NP PP : if NP VP , you therefore are not JJ .
i &apos;ve always been attra@@ cted to those rare people who pull that off , who de@@ vote their lives to humanity with the gr@@ it of DT NN and DT NN IN NP -- NNS IN NP . , who wrote , &quot; i can never be what i ought to be until NP VP .
or maybe your brother - in - law who doesn NP VP .
we agre@@ ed NP VP .
i travel@@ ed IN NP .
and he &apos;s IN NP .
and that NP VP .
but the question that l@@ ing@@ ered in my mind was , what causes people to destro@@ y NP VP ?
it &apos;s been repor@@ ted that NP VP , in NP VP .
and then the government sat IN NP and used PRP IN NP IN NP .
ro@@ ger . PRP VBD ADVP NP .
j well , because NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
and the engineering report had NN IN NP , so NP VP .
can that be JJ ?
that made NP ADJP IN NP . what VBD ADVP ?
the musi@@ cians played RP NP PP IN NP .
the ver@@ tical elements are as@@ sig@@ ned NP PP .
lau@@ ren ho@@ dge : if NP VP , which would PRP VB , S ?
so it was a big commit@@ ment to drive IN NP VP .
sounds JJ , JJ .
in NN , it &apos;s NP PP NN .
QP NNS RB .
so j@@ ul@@ ie &apos;s going to her doctor &apos;s office to get treated IN NP .
so i want NP VP .
and just like that , i went from being a woman that these kids would have been trained to see IN NP IN NP .
and interest@@ ingly , IN NP , what does it mean VP ?
RB NN NNS .
VBP NP .
so after being inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ated by this japanese man@@ ager for NP NP , he finally said , &quot; so , miss y@@ ang , do you have any questions to ask me ? &quot;
so today i want to talk IN NP IN NP .
first of all , most of PRP were born IN NP , IN NP .
so for NP , NP , they found themselves in NP PP .
while NP VP , but sometimes they &apos;re NP VP .
and our yo@@ unger generation are going to transform this country while at NP VP .
NP VP , but ADVP NP VP .
ne@@ c@@ essi@@ ty is NP PP .
but just looking RP IN NP , you really don NP VP .
a culture which VBZ NP , ow@@ ned , where NP PP VBP VP .
now , as@@ ca@@ p said NP NP .
i want VP ...
NP VP , and NP VP .
we can RB VB NP , INTJ , NP . &quot; and VBZ ADJP ?
because we &apos;re far IN NP , we &apos;re very ti@@ red . &quot;
so i know NP VP , but look , if IN NP PRP VBD SBAR , it &apos;s because NP VP .
if NP VP , you have VP IN S ?
lying has JJ NN IN NP IN NP .
DT NN IN NP , we &apos;re NP JJ .
we DT NN IN NP .
NP VP ; NP VP .
your new jo@@ int vent@@ ure partner might sha@@ ke PRP$ NN , celebra@@ te , go RP IN NP IN NP and then lea@@ k NP PP .
VB NP VP , it doesn JJ NN NN .
but you &apos;ve got TO VP : who do you want on your side of NP , NP CC NP ?
it &apos;s down@@ h@@ ill from RB RB . i wanted to VB NP .
DT NNS RB JJ .
nigeria got PRP$ NN IN NP .
so i had NP , NP , WHNP S .
and NP , NP VP , and NP VP .
and i watched them being lo@@ cked up in NP VP .
my friend r@@ on@@ ald got@@ tes@@ man says NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
and they decided in CD that NP VP .
now the reason NP VP is NP VP .
and i think that NP NP .
we know that NP VP .
well on september 4@@ th , there was a huge mop - up campaign , which is what you do IN NP .
NP VP : NP VP .
this is where you can see most of NP NP .
but RB , RB PRP VBP NP .
and this is WP NP VP .
so the fis@@ her@@ men are VBG NP .
RB WHNP PP VBP NP VP ?
which VBZ NP PP , why PRP VBP SBAR , is that NP VP .
so , basically , DT NN NN IN NP down there is JJ S .
and there , only there , you really feel that you are part IN NP or IN NP .
NP VP and NP VP , and DT NNS VBP NP .
PRP VBP ADJP .
and RB VBZ NP ADVP NP VP .
what we find out now is that it &apos;s probably coming from IN NP .
there are never any lights there , except the lights WDT NP VP .
they don NP VP .
b@@ l : this bacteria that we &apos;ve been talking IN turns out to be the most NP VP .
NNP NNP VP CC VP . NP VP , PRP VBZ ADJP .
this is WP NP VP , even if NP VP .
i believe IN NP .
and then as NP VP , we realize S .
how long will it take NP VP ?
and why DT VBZ NP right now is because NP VP .
DT NN IN NP , IN NP -- all those fantastic pictures -- is this really : that NP VP .
it was JJ .
so the challenges of education in NP PP are not to learn NP PP .
WP VBP NP VP ?
waiting 10 years for the pa@@ yo@@ ff from education is too long when you need to meet NP CC NP .
DT VBZ NP .
and there will VB NP . &quot;
you &apos;d need millions and millions of teachers in NP , NP , NP CC NP of developing NN VP .
but it is , IN NP , RB NP VP and NP VP .
RB as NP VP , i see NP SBAR , and it stuck IN NP IN NP .
and because PRP VBP NP , all NP VP is NN and VP .
NP VP ; NP VP !
DT JJ NN VBZ NP .
but when NP VP , and NP VP -- NP VP , it &apos;s about VP .
VBP NP .
DT IN NP even say NP ADJP .
entrop@@ y means that NP VP .
how was i supposed VP ?
if however , we can VP CC VP NP PP , neu@@ ral path@@ ways can change .
i know what &apos;s on your mind when you &apos;re looking IN NP .
they have to try and attra@@ ct pol@@ lin@@ ators to VB NP .
PRP VBZ NP .
DT VBZ NP .
last week i took NP VP .
ADVP NP VP , or ADVP NP VP . PRP VBP VP .
and NP VP , and NP VP . and NP , NP VBZ NP . DT VBZ NP .
and PRP VBZ , SBAR . NP VP , NP , INTJ NP VP . DT VBZ NP .
this is NP PP .
WP NP VP is NP PP .
you see the holding patterns that start to develop IN NP .
so they made this web service and said , &quot; any program@@ mer can write NP PP IN NP . &quot;
DT VBZ NP NP .
ADVP NP VP , and NP VP .
you &apos;d be VBN NP .
but we knew NP ADVP VP .
ak : so if you go to NP NP , WHNP S see is the video playing above .
VP : ADVP NP VP NP VP NP ADVP VP NP ADVP VP S S S : S , S .
and it &apos;s also just getting IN NP .
so if you don NP VP , it &apos;s inst@@ ant learning .
RB PRP VBZ NP . &quot;
and par@@ alle@@ l IN NP is my running .
PRP VBZ RB NP .
so IN NP , i saw NP PP .
so it acts as NP VP .
NN NN : NP VP
RB , NP PP VBZ NP .
NP , NP VP , but SBAR , NP VP .
there is another reason WRB NP VP than ever before .
but i think NP VP . it &apos;s an impossible dream .
now is there DT NN IN NP ?
and so we tend to VB NP .
psycho@@ analysis has been dru@@ mming NN NP PP .
IN ADVP PRP MD VP .
and i decided NP VP .
DT NN VBZ ADJP .
and i couldn NP VP .
and NP PP VBZ VP .
and NP VP and NP VP .
and DT JJ NN IN NP was IN NP .
yeah .
VBP NP . VBP NP .
and what about NN ?
NP VP , but NP ADVP VP .
that looks IN NP .
it &apos;s usually 90 percent . so , you tell me NP VP .
now , diabetes is NP PP .
there are NP SBAR .
so , i hope i &apos;ve convinced NP VP and ADVP NP VP .
WRB VBP NP VP ? lon@@ ge@@ vi@@ ty .
and NP VP , and SBAR , NP VP and PRP VBP NP and so forth .
and , S , VBP NP ? UH PDT DT NN IN NP .
VBP NP .
ADVP NP VP , and NP VP .
so you can la@@ vis@@ h NP VP .
so it &apos;s very much like in a hollywood movie where a guy flies IN NP , and then they take the wir@@ es away digit@@ ally so you &apos;re flying IN NP .
that NN - shaped region is WP NP VP .
and because NP VP , i thought , INTJ , VP .
but RB if NP VP i can VB NP . &quot;
i mean who would put PRP IN NP ?
la@@ par@@ o@@ scop@@ y is doing NP : NP IN NP .
and now , in NN to DT NN , NP VP , and NP VP .
and you need VP .
we get to write NP PP .
we can VB NP .
NP VP , and SBAR , NP VP .
RB RB VBP NP VP , but NP ADVP VP .
this means that NP VP .
VBP NP . NNP : VBP NP .
but people live IN NP .
this is NP PP .
its early version had DT NML NN NN . NP VP like .
here &apos;s a film NP VP .
so we &apos;re going to VB NP .
so , &quot; NP VP .
and there are NP PP . this is NP PP .
it &apos;s about WRB NP VP . and there is this huge , beautiful common@@ ality between NP , NP CC NP .
that &apos;s WP NP ADVP VP .
it was NN HYPH VBG .
but if S CC S , RB if NP VP , if NP VP , you can VP CC VP .
so , that &apos;s a scen@@ ari@@ o that we think NP VP .
these young boys are IN NP .
NN , RB , VBZ NP .
children res@@ cu@@ ed IN NP IN NP , re@@ united IN NP , and then taken IN NP RB PP .
however , only recently , due to several technologi@@ cal advan@@ c@@ ements , we are now able to demon@@ strate IN NP NP CC NP .
well , first there are str@@ ands of NP VP .
now , i can ex@@ tend this cir@@ cular mag@@ net , and make whatever track NP VP .
and NP VP , and NP VP . &quot;
but anyway , i got PRP$ NN IN NP and dra@@ g@@ ged it back IN NP on DT NN , and then was fac@@ ed IN NP : INTJ , SBAR ?
and NP VP , and , PP , NP VP .
that &apos;s PRP IN NP IN .
WRB NP VP , we all shared NP SBAR .
ADVP NP VP , so NP VP .
communication technologies : 50 different ways to measure NP , NP .
and we will begin to actually deeply influence NP CC NP , IN S .
this was in NP VP .
PP ADVP , NP VP -- NP VP .
NN CD : NP VP . NN CD : JJ NN ?
and it &apos;s one that off@@ ers really interesting possibilities for organi@@ zing NP PP IN NP .
it is very easy to fall IN NP IN NP .
and NP VP , and NP ADVP VP .
i keep thinking IN NP .
i &apos;m going to VB NP NP . can we look at this thing ?
it all began WRB NP VP .
and with sal@@ ting , it became possible to VB NP and to VB NP long di@@ stances .
and so one of the tools that we can use to sam@@ ple NP VP , or sound waves .
well WP NP VP was VBN NN .
this is something NP VP .
but the really interesting thing about it is that , a few years ago , cen@@ su@@ s scientists discovered that NP VP .
so we still have quite a lot of work to do IN NP .
and the oceans are so productive , there &apos;s so much going on in there that &apos;s IN NP IN NP .
CC NP VP ; NP VP .
you know , i am so bad IN NP , if NP VP , PRP$ NN NN S .
NP VP -- NP VP ; NP VP -- and NP VP .
and i think that NP VP .
we are , should be , mor@@ ally commit@@ ted to being DT NN IN NP .
RB DT VBZ RB ADJP . ADVP NP , and NP VP .
now why is that NP CC NP ?
NP VP , PRP VBZ NP S .
RB WP VBP NP ?
and what ba@@ yes &apos; S is that NP VP , and NP VP .
now there &apos;s good reason to believe that NP VP .
as you go IN NP , it becomes more ti@@ ck@@ li@@ sh at DT NN .
we started IN NP IN NP .
so i have NP PP .
if NP VP &apos;ll have NP , ADJP .
you have to study NN IN NP .
and yes , the red planet is JJ .
RB VBP NP .
and what we &apos;re VP is the pres@@ ence of NP , NP , in NP PP .
PP NP VP , EX VBP NP .
we will fly WRB NP VP .
we believe that PP NP VP .
if NP VP , we have NP SBAR .
i was INTJ , VP .
then you notice that IN NP ADVP , NP VP and VP and NNS VBG NP .
i &apos;m really sc@@ ared . i don NP VP .
so , look WP NP VP .
but DT NN HYPH NN VBZ ADJP .
california em@@ its NP PP .
NP NP VBP PP . DT NNS NN . CD NNS DT NN .
do you know , they only invest@@ ed NP PP IN NP ?
it could be NP PP .
DT NN VBZ NP .
because , as NP VP , we live PRP$ NNS IN NP , and these networks have NP PP .
so , if NP VP is VP .
so , we thought NP VP .
and the size of the dots is going to be propor@@ tional to how NP PP VBP NP .
and DT NN VBZ NP .
and there are CD NNS , NP VP , that NP VP .
IN NP , NP VP , and PP , NP VP .
and PRP RB VBP NP .
today , they live in NP , NP .
in a region famous IN NP , there lived until recently an esti@@ ma@@ ted 40 million people in these houses under@@ ground .
so you know how it ended up , NP VP .
IN NP VBP NP PP .
so a person that &apos;s inter@@ acting with the robot under@@ stands where it &apos;s going to reach and isn NP VP .
NP NP .
and VBD PRT NP , NP age goes up very , very fast , as NP VP .
the system meas@@ ures NP VP .
and ADVP , NP VP , and ADVP NP VP .
JJ NN , PRP VBD NP .
ben k@@ ac@@ y@@ ra : ancient wonder@@ s cap@@ tured IN NP
we had NP PP .
it will re@@ fer PRP RB IN NP , IN NP , IN NP .
european governments , for the most part , haven &apos; t ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ged NN , and there &apos;s NP VP RB RB S .
he was bo@@ bby ken@@ ne@@ dy - like because in some ways one could never tell if NP VP , as people always wonder@@ ed about bo@@ bby ken@@ ne@@ dy and john kennedy in that way .
but , u@@ h-@@ oh , the kill@@ ers are IN NP .
you &apos;re JJ .
don JJ NN NML NN . don NP VP .
fourth and JJ NN : NP SBAR &apos;s NP CC NP , had NP , PP , and NP PP IN NP .
some are VBN PP , feel NP VP one of NP PP .
NP IN , PRP VBP NP .
and yet , in many places , a third of the children , by DT NN S are facing DT NN IN NP due IN NP .
and these types of technologies , i see , have the potential to transform the face of NP , NP out on the front lines .
ADVP PP , NP VP , and PP , NP VP .
it is a win - win - win situation that starts NP VP .
well , the world bank esti@@ mates NP VP .
RB , DT VBZ NP .
as NP VP ? very , very common .
why ? because we know what NP VP , and NP VP -- although we can &apos; t make v@@ acc@@ ine in this country , but that &apos;s a different story .
and i think that &apos;s been NP PP , is that NP VP .
and so , if NP VP , there &apos;s NP CC NP .
if NP VP , QP NN IN NP have DT JJ NN IN NP .
so , instead IN NP , we &apos;re VP .
NP VP , VP NP or RB ?
and so , as a cancer doctor , instead of having NN IN NP , in your ch@@ art , and it being this thi@@ ck , this is what data flow is starting to look like IN NP , WRB NP VP .
NP VP , and , ADVP , NP VP .
SBAR , NP VP ; PP , NP VP .
you all recognize that NP . this is the most - played NP PP NN .
and i stood there bes@@ i@@ de two RB JJ friends of NP , NP CC NP .
so we would have a live website , that NP , NP VP , or NP VP .
that NP VP ?
i actually love di@@ ving at night ; you see a lot of fish then that you don NP VP .
no matter WRB PP NP VP .
we can VP CC VP .
we kill VP , IN NP .
and , in 197@@ 2 , this nation began to establi@@ sh a counter@@ part in NP , NP .
but , nothing else will matter if NP VP .
IN NP , RB VBD VP .
they have NP PP .
DT NN VBZ NP PP .
and these are the two concep@@ ts NP VP .
ADVP NP VP , and NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
ADVP NP VP , PP NP VP , ADVP NP VP . &quot;
we &apos;re just pac@@ king in colum@@ ns , so that we &apos;d have NP VP .
and we did that for NP , VP we came across .
and when PRP VBP NP is that NP VP .
RB , WHADVP S , VBP NP . WRB VBZ NP VP ? &quot;
this took NN IN NP -- NP PP .
&quot; spac@@ es@@ hi@@ p project offi@@ cially be@@ gun . job waiting IN NP . dy@@ son . &quot;
ADVP , NP VP ; NP VP .
this VBZ NP : VBZ , NP , NP .
NP VP , S , but NP VP .
WDT NP VP is RB JJ .
RB RB JJ .
giving your organs to somebody else is probably about how much you care about society , how lin@@ ked NP VP .
ADVP , SBAR , NP ADVP VP -- but ADVP NP VP .
this is IN NP .
RB VBZ NP .
DT NN NN IN NP .
and because NP VP we &apos;re JJ PP IN NP : NP , NP .
the sil@@ ver lin@@ ing is , NP VP , RB PP WDT NP VP .
NP VP ; NP VP ; and NP ADVP VP .
and then we have the radio waves , NP VP .
and this is a fundamental basic property that we explo@@ it IN NP .
you think , VP .
and then i &apos;ve VBN NP .
and then you have these millions of NP VP .
NP VP ; NP ADVP VP .
and look at NP CC NP we &apos;ve been able VP .
and then james wat@@ son &apos;s -- one of the co-@@ fo@@ under@@ s of NN -- genome was done IN NP , and IN NP .
NP VP , and NP ADVP VP .
we could VB NP .
and he had the best answer NP ADVP VP . &quot;
i &apos;m VP NP , NP . &quot;
and WP NP VP is NP SBAR .
and that &apos;s how NP VP , and NP VP .
so we go , &quot; sit , &quot; IN NP NP VP , &quot; NN , NP VP ; NP VP , &quot; say hell@@ o to DT JJ NN .
they think NP VP .
your head now is NP RB , VP , ok ?
and ug@@ ly face is NP : S ! now VB NP , VB NP , VB NP ! &quot;
PRP RB VBZ .
VBG PP , train@@ er ian dun@@ bar as@@ ks NP VP . by VP , we can VB NP . it &apos;s NP SBAR .
and PRP VBD NP ADVP
NN : INTJ , NP VP .
and so this is basically DT NN IN NP , but not DT NN IN NP .
and that &apos;s WP NP VP .
every time i read NP CC NP , i &apos;m remin@@ ded IN SBAR .
what about ADJP NNS ?
that &apos;s NP JJR IN NP that NP VP , i &apos;m sure .
NP , NP -- not NP , NP , NP ?
how did we become the only species that becomes more pro@@ sper@@ ous as NP VP ?
and it &apos;s NP , NP , IN S , because NP VP .
there &apos;s no exchange of NP PP .
and that &apos;s seven and a half seconds of pro@@ sper@@ ity that you &apos;ve ga@@ ined since 19@@ 50 , as it were , because NP VP , or NP VP .
we &apos;re able to draw IN NP VP .
and so both sides raise each other &apos;s standards of living IN NP .
and that will have led IN NP .
the person on the assem@@ bly line doesn &apos; t know because he doesn NP VP .
my work is IN NP .
CC NP VP , but NP VP .
and this is WP NP VP .
as NP VP , DT NN IN S is NP : NP .
PRP VBP S , and NP ADVP VP , and NP VP .
but really , it &apos;s RB JJ .
and there &apos;re QP IN S VBG NP : NP VP .
RB IN RB JJ , but RB , NP , NP ?
we put DT NN IN NP .
i mean , they went to NP PP .
and WDT NP VP , is that NP , ADVP VP NP PP -- NP SBAR .
joe der@@ is@@ i : VBG NP
here &apos;s the first battery -- DT NN IN NP , separ@@ ated IN NP .
the electro@@ ly@@ te is not NP , CONJP NP .
it &apos;s RB JJ , ADVP IN NP .
NP RB , NP CC NP VBD NP S .
don@@ ald sa@@ do@@ way : DT VBG NN IN NP
so i want to VB NP NP .
did PRP VB NP ?
things where you might trip across things like NP , NP , NP , NP .
so pretty much players are encoura@@ ged to be very creative IN NP .
so this is the planet that we &apos;ve been playing on up to NP PP .
now here , our entire oceans are ev@@ a@@ por@@ ating off the surface , and as it kee@@ ps getting hot@@ ter at NP NP &apos;s going to melt down .
and so you &apos;d VB NP , PP , and this is RB WHNP S . and so really , part of DT is about VP , to NP PP , so that NP VP .
RB DT NN and DT JJ NNP NNS .
so they do this both WRB NP VP , and also WRB NP VP .
so business schools have been strug@@ gling IN NP .
probably not , right ? you want the person who &apos;s powerful and as@@ ser@@ tive and domin@@ ant , but not very stress re@@ active , NP VP .
so two minutes lead IN NP , and , you know , feeling sort of shu@@ t RP . and we &apos;ve NP VP ?
PRP RB VBP NP ADVP . &quot;
and NP , CC NP VBZ NP . DT VBZ NP .
CD NNS , CD NNS , CD NNS .
RB PRP VB PRT PP , or NP VP , and NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
RB , NP VBP NP VP ?
not NN .
there are other par@@ as@@ ites that VBP NP -- which ren@@ der NP ADJP .
they &apos;re RB DT JJ NN IN NP .
NP , VP , NN NN , was JJR IN NP , RB , IN NP .
NP VP , PP , NP VP .
they don NP VP .
do PRP VB NP ?
RB VBN , NP CC NP .
ly@@ n : when i &apos;m VBG NP , i feel like a pilot in NP VP .
my un@@ cle ed gave me a beautiful blue swe@@ ater -- at least i thought NP VP .
NP VP ; NP VP .
they are NP CC NP .
it &apos;s esti@@ ma@@ ted that NP VP .
she runs NP PP , and has RB VBN NP S .
well three sons got IN NP .
how do we deal with our deep@@ est differences , given NP PP and NP PP ?
and we can VB NP .
now let NP VP .
now as anthropo@@ logi@@ sts , we know that NP VP .
and that &apos;s what comes IN NP RB .
let NP VP .
and so that &apos;s WP NP VP .
but they did PRP NP IN NP .
nat@@ al@@ ie ma@@ c@@ master : cape bre@@ ton fi@@ dd@@ ling IN NP
NP VP , and NP VP , WHNP SQ .
NP CC NP VBP ADJP .
DT VBZ NP .
they do NP PP .
they could tra@@ p DT NNS , send PRP IN NP IN NP .
NP VP , VBZ NP VP ?
so WRB NP VP , people hate PRP .
and RB , NP VP , NP VP .
i &apos;m not saying NP VP .
but it all starts IN NP , IN NP .
and WDT NP NP VP ? UH , NP VP , and NP VP .
that &apos;s a picture NP VP .
so we started VP .
and WRB NP VP , you exp@@ and PRP$ NN .
and again , when you can take kids from NP ADJP as NP VP , we &apos;re really creating a moment .
people , you can all VB NP .
FW FW FW !
UH , IN NP , IN NP , IN S , DT VBD NP .
so there it was , th@@ ur@@ s@@ day morning we stopped NP VP and there is his electro@@ gra@@ m , the signal from inside the pi@@ g &apos;s heart coming out by radio tele@@ me@@ try .
that &apos;s the first invention WDT NP VP .
st@@ acy sa@@ ger : but for christ@@ ina si@@ de@@ bottom , almost anything was worth trying if NP VP .
DT VBZ ADVP NP .
a signal in the brain WDT VP might be sen@@ sed as NP PP like NP VP .
NP VP and NP VP and NP VP , do PRP VB NP ? no , i don JJ NN .
and so there is NP PP .
you see DT IN NP , RB . you get DT NN NN .
after NP VP , i realized IN S .
PP , ADVP NP , but NP VP .
NN IN NP IN NP IN NP .
companies like national instru@@ ments , who are em@@ bed@@ ding very powerful , inter@@ active simu@@ lations into the materials , so that we can go way IN NP to DT NN that NP VP .
so what PRP VBP S is moving NP CC NP IN NP IN NP .
and people who are NP , SBAR , you know this -- it &apos;s NP PP .
we &apos;re not talking about NP , NP ?
and if NP VP , it actually last week said S .
and these are two an@@ ec@@ d@@ ot@@ es -- one was in cam@@ bo@@ dia , in a village that has NP , NP , NP , NP , but has NP ADVP .
we &apos;re interested in NP , NP .
it &apos;s the rest -- that NP VP .
is PRP NP SBAR ? no .
by law you &apos;ve VP .
because there &apos;s NP PP .
and if NP VP ?
PRP MD VP , and NP VP , and ADVP NP VP .
and i said , &quot; NP VP . &quot;
these are NP : NP , NP CC NP .
i want NP VP .
IN NP , IN NP , NP PP VBP VP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
your baby is going VP . &quot;
the second : VB S , VP , VP : NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
we &apos;ve cho@@ sen to re@@ define the NN NN system as NP , NP CC NP .
NNS IN NP car@@ ing IN NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
EX VBP ADVP . NP VP , but ADVP NP VP . RB S CC RB , NP PP VBP NP .
but ADVP NP VP , so NP VP .
see , PRP VBD NP , and NP VP , and ADVP NP VP .
but i knew what he meant , because it would be possible to take a bunch of pictures of NP PP and RB , RB , NP NP in a computer system such that it would appear that NP VP .
NP VP , SBAR , NP VP , and ADVP NP ADVP VP .
NP , NP VP , and NP VP .
the more that robots ing@@ rain PRP IN NP , the more we &apos;re forced to VB NP PP . at tedx@@ ber@@ k@@ ele@@ y , ken gold@@ berg shares four very human lessons that he &apos;s learned from working IN NP . & lt ; em & gt ; & lt ; / em & gt ;
in fact , it is said that in the collective consciousness of africa , we get to experience NP PP IN NP IN NP .
and there was NP , NP .
as NP VP , sol@@ ly arri@@ ves IN NP .
she arrived IN NP IN NP IN NP .
and while NP VP is NP PP .
now ka@@ es@@ a@@ va had NP NP PP IN .
perhaps loss of NN is so cru@@ cial IN NP .
well , WRB NP VP , i never see NP VP . i actually see NP VP .
i actually inclu@@ ded NNS IN NP .
i must ad@@ mit , i used to be NP PP .
i discovered that NP VP .
bir@@ ke ba@@ e@@ hr : what &apos;s wrong IN NP
and you can see that it kind of ho@@ ck@@ ey sti@@ cks up around NP CC NP , and it &apos;s on NP PP right now .
se@@ amo@@ unts are important IN NP .
and what &apos;s NP PP ?
i &apos;d like to go back and share it with the government of ki@@ ri@@ bat@@ i , who are over in NP , NP .
it had occur@@ red IN NP , IN NP .
NP VP , but SBAR , NP VP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
ADVP IN NP , NP VP , and NP VP . VB S .
in the short term , we can stimu@@ late job growth by encoura@@ ging NN and by invest@@ ing IN NP IN NP .
so the work of NP , NP , is DT IN NP . and this is kind IN SBAR .
NNS RB RB .
DT VBZ NP .
and , la@@ stly , under VP they had NP PP .
he didn NP VP .
which brought me back to my list making -- you know , just to see WP NP ADVP VP .
ADVP NP VP : VP . &quot;
the other condition is in NP VP .
for example , there &apos;s particular em@@ ph@@ as@@ is on NN IN NP .
perhaps the biggest change for the worse is that our el@@ der@@ ly are obje@@ c@@ tively less useful than IN NP .
RB , NP PP MD VP .
those are just some examples of what we can learn IN NP .
and so the back@@ story of the 99 takes place in 12@@ 5@@ 8 , which history tells us the mon@@ g@@ ols VBD NP and VBD NP .
NP PP VBN NP .
NP VP -- NP VP . PRP VBD NP NP .
RB RB VBZ NP , NP .
opened a theme park through DT NN IN NP a year and a half ago called the 99 village theme park -- NP : NP .
i don S . i don NP VP .
and the first one was about a group called NP PP . red was made illegal .
ra@@ y@@ an VBD NP and VBD NP PRT PP .
that is , NP VP .
so i want to VB NP NP ADVP .
WRB NP ?
UH , JJ NN MD VP .
RB NP ADJP PP .
so massive , in NN , that NP VP .
NP VP , and ADVP NP VP .
so let NP VP .
NP VP , PRP VBP S .
now WP NP VP is NP PP , and nobody would VB NP .
and that &apos;s a perfectly reas@@ on@@ able theory in the sense that almost everything else in NP PP .
this is NN NN . it sm@@ ells IN NP .
the bad news is NP VP .
this is NP PP .
and i said , first of all , let NP VP .
i come IN IN NP .
running through DT JJ NN that NP VP , i ran it through my simpli@@ city lab , it &apos;s pretty un@@ intelli@@ gi@@ ble .
mo@@ ses ! -- NP PP VBZ NP ; NP NP ; NP : NP ! -- NP NP ; NP NP ; NP PP &quot; DT NN NN . &quot;
NP VP , so NP VP .
CC NP VP , so NP VP .
but because NP VP , they could VB NP PP .
le@@ m@@ n s@@ is@@ say : DT NN IN NP
we still really haven &apos; t got NP PP .
and if NP VP , there &apos;s NP SBAR .
and he rema@@ ined there until 1.@@ 6 million years later , when this very famous fossil h@@ unter , kam@@ o@@ ya ki@@ me@@ u , walked along a small h@@ ill@@ side and found that small piece of NP VP , recogni@@ zed it as VP .
i think NP VP .
well , to end IN NP , i think evolution@@ arily speaking , NP VP , in DT NN .
NP VP and NP VP .
you can see that i even made a museum lab@@ el for it that inclu@@ des NP PP .
NP VP , and NP VP -- NP VP , NP VP , NP VP .
i &apos;ll go NP NP : IN NP , during DT NN IN NP , &quot; called NP NP , NP VP , the NNP NNP coun@@ ty museum of NN had NP PP -- NP PP , i think , made for DT NN -- stol@@ en out of DT NN . a lot of people thought it was NP PP .
there NP NP WHNP S , NP VP , you lose NP PP .
PRP VBD NP .
the next conc@@ ern was whether NP VP .
i was lying IN NP .
in NP , SBAR .
it was everybody VP . and then i knew , just like RB , that PRP VBD NP . i could keep VP or i could let go and accept CONJP NP CC NP .
and they took one look and ran out the back to VB NP .
ADVP NP VP , NP VP , and NP VP .
the pilot light inside of PRP was still a light , just as NP VP .
and we should be developing NP : S NP PP and trans@@ late into NP PP .
WRB NP VP , i &apos;ll VB NP .
it comes RB IN NP .
it cost 1.@@ 7 million dollars to develop . it &apos;s called &quot; go &quot; by NP , NP .
that is NP PP .
NP VP , and ADVP NP VP .
i &apos;ve been ban@@ ging on IN NP like i can &apos; t believe .
and that &apos;s what i do IN NP .
NP VP -- NP VP .
IN NP VBZ NP NP , NP .
NP VP , and ADVP NP VP .
IN NP NP , NP , VBP PP .
RB , NP VP , and NP VP .
NP VP and ADVP NP VP .
and then to generate the display you &apos;re about to VB , all NP VP was NN PRP once per NN IN NP with a shar@@ p pick that &apos;s sort of like NP PP .
but NP VP , and NP VP .
edi@@ th wid@@ der : JJ NN IN NP
so as NP VP .
so NP : NP VP , i VBD NP , VBD NP , and VBD S .
here &apos;s one of my fellow w@@ inn@@ ers . that &apos;s charles pa@@ x@@ ton who won the 2000 biology prize for NP , NP under NP PP . &quot;
the mis@@ sion@@ ary position is very rare IN NP .
and SBAR , NP VP and NP VP .
NP VP , and PP , NP ADVP VP .
prin@@ ce charles has NP PP .
and the good thing about VP is that NP VP , so i think NP VP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
but the reality is , NP VP . they don NP ADVP VP .
it &apos;s very hard to measure because NP VP .
it doesn NP VP does it ?
people -- for law to be NP PP , people have to trust it .
so , WP NP VP is VP .
NP NP VBP NP-TMP .
NP VP , and NP VP . VBP NP .
or -- or maybe and -- in NN IN NP , let NP VP want TO VP is in their interest to serve our interest -- the magic in@@ centi@@ ves WDT VP .
well if NP VP , it &apos;s RB JJ VP .
PRP VBD NP .
he did after all VBP NP .
but NP VP , and NP VP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
there are now 22 cities that have NP PP .
so there are NP PP .
NP VP , and NP VP : PRP MD VP .
IN NP , NP VP , and NP VP .
so the goal was to VB NP .
there are NP SBAR .
they are RB JJ CC JJ .
this is the size of the &quot; little boy &quot; bom@@ b that was dro@@ pped IN NP .
in NP NP-TMP , DT S -- and NP VP -- is VP .
so separ@@ ation -- hopefully with di@@ rt or con@@ cre@@ te , or being IN NP -- distance and time is what will save you .
NP , NP , VBG NP .
and many of PRP here are deeply involved IN NP .
and that &apos;s clear@@ er now than it &apos;s been IN NP .
that &apos;s what business does WRB NP VP .
business does RB NN IN S , actually not IN NP .
we see companies like the brazi@@ li@@ an fore@@ stry company fi@@ bri@@ a that &apos;s figured out how to avoid VP CC VP than NP VP .
if we can break RP NP PP , this un@@ e@@ ase , this ten@@ sion , this sense that NP VP , NP VP , and NP ADVP , NP VP , can have solutions .
this shows NP PP .
it doesn NP VP .
they &apos;re even more sho@@ cked by WP NP VP .
they talked IN NP IN NP .
each month requi@@ red 1,@@ 3@@ 65 calcu@@ lations , so NP VP .
RB VBZ NP ADVP .
one day a nasa man@@ ager comes into PRP$ NN , si@@ ts down and says , &quot; can you please tell PRP , how do we look IN NP IN NP ? &quot;
so he was VBN , but , IN NP , NP NP .
and it is in NN due to NP CC NP .
and as NP VP , there are NP SBAR .
and obviously DT IN NP comes RP IN NP .
it doesn &apos; t matter what kind of se@@ di@@ ment you &apos;re using to gr@@ ind up , whether it &apos;s NP CC NP .
so let NP VP .
and if NP VP , then i think S .
this is DT NN NN , and WHNP S , PRP VBP ADJP , NP , and NP VP , NP NP , NP VP .
now try and wra@@ p your head around NP PP .
NP VP , PP , NP VP -- S , CC S , NP VP , SBAR , ADVP NP VP .
ADVP NP VP , but PP NP VP .
but EX VBP NP ADVP .
colle@@ cting global health data was an im@@ perfect science : workers tra@@ mp@@ ed IN NP VP . data ge@@ ek jo@@ el sel@@ ani@@ ki@@ o talks through the sea change in NP PP -- starting with NP CC NP , and now moving into DT NN . & lt ; em & gt ; & lt ; / em & gt ;
and SBAR NP VP .
VP , VP .
but NP VP ; NP VP .
but it will not be possible in NP NP .
WRB NP ? because NP VP .
and this is exactly DT NN IN NP .
but much more , to VB NP , to VB NP , to VB NP SBAR .
you see , it used to be that if NP VP , you needed NP CC NP .
don NP VP .
and WP NP VP is NP PP .
you see , it &apos;s not as dra@@ matic IN NP .
don &apos; t NP VP that IN NP , that JJ NNS VBP NP ?
this is NP , NP .
so why , then , are NP RB VP ?
NN VBZ VP .
RB VBZ DT NN NN .
DT JJ minutes ago , i talked about NP VP .
i really believe that NP VP .
i think NP VP .
now , &quot; NP VP is a great love song .
people with color@@ ed hearing actually see colors when they hear NP PP .
they took longer to re@@ je@@ ct metaph@@ ors as fal@@ se than NP VP fal@@ se sent@@ ences .
those ex@@ posed to NP NP made more interven@@ tion@@ ist re@@ com@@ men@@ da@@ tions than the others .
a@@ ph@@ or@@ ism enth@@ usi@@ ast and auth@@ or james ge@@ ary NP : NP . NN IN NP , NP VP , ge@@ ary VBZ .
but we want VP .
and he said , &quot; NP VP . &quot;
p@@ m : and we should point out that NP VP .
NP VP ; NP VP .
RB , NP VP ; NP VP .
IN S , NP PP VBP NP . NP NP VP CC VP .
my father and my grand@@ father were always looking for NP CC NP , but after six months , i couldn &apos; t walk IN NP . i couldn &apos; t clim@@ b DT NN IN NP .
it certainly didn NP VP .
my doctor wanted me to get IN NP .
but NP VP , and NP VP .
medical conditions don NP VP .
and many of these chemicals are now lin@@ ked to the sky@@ rock@@ eting inci@@ dents of chr@@ onic childhood disease that we &apos;re seeing IN NP .
and you can see NP , VP .
but NP IN S VBP NP .
in addition to that , after the baby &apos;s born , our other unique invention as ma@@ mm@@ als is that we n@@ our@@ ish our off@@ spring after NP VP .
th : NP PP IN NP is IN , INTJ , S . &apos; &quot; NP VP . &quot;
and NP VP and NP VP .
here is NP PP .
that day i ended up VBG NP .
all the king &apos;s NNS and NP NP ...
but NP , NP WHNP S .
and with NP PP , he took PRP IN NP VP .
SBAR , NP VP , and ADVP NP VP .
NP VP VBZ PRT NP PRP .
they &apos;re finding out that NP VP .
what can the red@@ wo@@ ods tell PRP IN NP ?
richard pre@@ ston , VBP NP ADVP , i think .
the p@@ c virus problem is NP JJ RB .
and you can see at DT NN IN NP , there &apos;s a centi@@ pe@@ de sc@@ roll@@ ing across your computer when you get infe@@ cted IN NP .
well there &apos;s multiple different ways , such as ban@@ king tro@@ j@@ ans , which will ste@@ al money from your online ban@@ king accoun@@ ts when you do NP , CC NP .
they also use NP PP IN NP .
and that &apos;s NP SBAR .
now i &apos;m not DT NN , but if NP VP , &quot; NP VP . &quot;
so prepar@@ e@@ dness means that NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
and many of you may have noticed that NP VP .
we &apos;ve increas@@ ed PRP IN NP .
NP VP : NP VP .
and down IN NP they would VB NP .
NN VBZ RB ADJP : NP VP , but NP VP .
whether you &apos;re NP , NP , NP CC NP , the hand@@ ling of copy@@ right directly im@@ pac@@ ts your life .
and then they benefit through NP , NP CC NP .
RB NP NP .
if NP VP , you might VB NP PP .
sat@@ aw@@ al is CD NN - mile long by NP RB .
this is NN IN NP .
it &apos;s NP PP .
you don &apos; t work in your self - interest all the time , because when emotion comes into NP , NP it fun@@ ctions .
so , i &apos;ve S ? like all the resources they say S . PRP VBD NP NP ; PRP VBD NP NP . PRP VBD S ; PRP VBD NP NP . you were RB VP .
NP VP ; NP VP .
hon@@ est@@ ly , RB or JJR ? say , &quot; a@@ ye . &quot;
NP PP VBZ NP . DT VBZ SBAR .
WRB JJ IN NP ADVP VBP NP ? say , &quot; a@@ ye . &quot;
if NP PP , get DT NN . don NP VP . get NP ADJP ?
now , 18 years later , i &apos;m proud VP , last year we f@@ ed QP NNS IN NP through NP , NP -- in NP PP .
she said , &quot; NP VP . &quot; SBAR , NP , NP VP , i just want PRP TO VP . it was stupid IN NP . &quot; NP VP , because NP VP , WRB NP VP , &quot; hon@@ ey , i can &apos; NP VP . &quot;
and that was lar@@ gely because NP VP .
and we define PRP IN NP .
any do@@ t can be cli@@ cked and exp@@ and@@ ed . and we see here , &quot; i would just feel so much better if i could cur@@ l up in his arms right now and feel his affe@@ ction for me in NP PP and NP PP . &quot;
the next movement is VBN NP .
ADVP NP VP , NP ADJP , NP ADJP . &quot;
NP VP , WP VP ? NNP VBP NP . &quot;
PRP VBZ NP : S .
we can click IN NP and have the photograph be DT NN IN NP .
RB PRP VBP NP . RB PRP VBP NP .
but i think NP ADJP , VP ?
WP MD NP VP ? PRP VBP NP .
NP VP , and NP VP -- NP VP , and PP , PP , NP VP , and IN S , NP PP VBP PRT PP .
the shar@@ p , cris@@ p out@@ lines of DT NN VB NP NP .
let NP VP .
using computers , even though they &apos;re getting faster and better all the time , it &apos;s a challenge to deal with gi@@ gab@@ y@@ tes of NP , NP and extra@@ cting the relevant information .
you can see that NP VP .
and again , it &apos;s fully inter@@ active , so NP VP and NP VP .
it really just works IN NP .
and VP , DT VBZ NP .
ADVP NP VP , and ADVP NP VP .
i can NN IN NP .
and so it was simply ast@@ on@@ ishing to me to find NP SBAR .
he said , RB JJ . i measu@@ red DT NN IN NP .
the standard explan@@ ation is that the universe somehow spr@@ ang into existence , full of NP : NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
and the next map now shows africa &apos;s NN IN NP , around NP PP .
and IN NP , PRP VBD NP NP .
NP VP and NP VP .
i will be VBG NP .
i want VP .
and our part@@ ners across NNS are extremely enth@@ usi@@ a@@ stic IN NP .
when computers were first introduced , they were said to be NP JJR IN NP .
and let NP ADVP VP . so the bottom line : DT NN VBZ NP S .
now , NP VP , they no longer be@@ have IN NP .
ok , so a computer pi@@ cks DT JJ NN IN NP , it sen@@ ds it into NP CC NP , and then it puts the result back IN NP .
this is NP NP and IN S .
i was coming at it from a different perspective , where i was bringing that NP VP .
so , despite the fact that NP VP , and NP VP , it has no fin@@ ite size .
i need to understand the mass of DT NN NP VP , and WP NP VP .
so , at NP ADVP , that NP FRAG .
which is the job WDT NP VP .
NP VP and NP VP .
and because of that , we &apos;ve been able to show that NP VP .
in fact , we anti@@ ci@@ p@@ ated that NP VP .
and i hope , if nothing else , i &apos;ve convinced NP VP .
and WRB NP VP , WRB NP VP , really fascin@@ ates PRP .
but the way we re@@ act IN NP is complex and emotional and not totally understood .
but every musi@@ cian stri@@ kes a different balance between NP CC NP .
it &apos;s NP SBAR .
the culture IN WHNP NP VP is a@@ was@@ h IN NP .
and it exc@@ ites me now to meet people who are NP , NP , NP , NP , NP i never would have gu@@ essed who loved the music and who are pas@@ sing it on .
the real key obser@@ vation NP VP is that NP VP .
if NP VP , i &apos;ll VB NP .
that comes from the last name of one of NP NP .
and ADVP NP VP , and ADVP NP VP .
now , she cho@@ se NP , NP .
it felt IN NP .
it &apos;s based IN NP .
it &apos;s by giving away WP NP VP .
but what NP NP RB VBZ , the reason NP VP is because NP VP .
RB NP NP IN NP .
it &apos;s RB RB .
schools can &apos; NP VP .
the same tr@@ ash site is VBG NP .
now , to make this more con@@ cre@@ te , let &apos;s look at the list of top 10 words that statisti@@ cally stick out IN NP and IN NP .
and analysis shows if NP VP , you should VP , VP CC VP NP .
ADVP NP VP , and NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP . NP VP , and NP VP .
and DT JJ NN VBZ NP .
can@@ aries used to be used IN NP .
read mon@@ ta@@ gue : what we &apos;re learning IN NP
politics and politicians will only succe@@ ed if they actually try and treat with people as they are , rather than as they would like NP VP .
right now , here we are lin@@ ked up to NP , CC NP , and we can send and recei@@ ve JJ NNS IN NP without NP VP .
and you can see this looks NP IN S , but actually that &apos;s NP , NP .
RB , ADVP NP VP , NP VP ; VP .
how would i know who VBD NP ?
some teachers are RB RBR effective IN NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
NP VP -- NP VP .
then we like VP .
let NP VP .
if NN IN NP got VBN , who knows WP NP VP ?
but PRP VBP SBAR ?
we &apos;re going to hear IN NP .
because NP VP .
now drug use or pos@@ s@@ ession is illegal IN NP .
we can also train jud@@ ges so that NP VP and so that NP VP .
NP CC NP VBD .
the office building is basically ob@@ so@@ le@@ te for VBG NP .
this is RB NP PP .
we hope to have NP VP .
we don &apos; t really believe IN NP VP .
and they are thought to be able to filter a cu@@ bi@@ c kilometer of NP NP and can feed on 30 kil@@ os of zo@@ o plan@@ k@@ ton a day to survive .
we &apos;re RB RB fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed of NNS thanks IN NP . &quot;
it might be NP PP .
i &apos;ll show you WP NP VP .
so very simple things like that , we &apos;re trying to learn IN NP .
but again , it &apos;s kind IN ADJP . you wouldn NP ADVP VP .
that &apos;s ban@@ ned RB , and that NP be NP PP .
and they sat IN NP IN NP .
you probably saw the hum@@ p@@ back wh@@ ale foot@@ age WDT NP VP .
so VBP NP and VBP NP PP .
they got NP ADJP .
so IN NP , i kept JJ .
but again , i can only affect society and affect government if NP VP .
WRB VBD NP VP ? NP VP , PRP VBP , INTJ ?
does your breath smell bad while you &apos;re VP ?
NP VP , and NP VP .
i was just allowed to VB NP , growing and changing IN NP .
life magazine introduced NP PP IN NP .
this is my contribu@@ tion to NP PP .
ADVP NP VP and NP VP .
it &apos;s RB JJ .
appar@@ ently , lu@@ ci@@ fer means VB NP . &quot;
DT IN NP come IN NP .
we look at what &apos;s inside of NP , NP .
DT VBZ NP and PRP VBD NP , NP MD NP VP ? &quot;
PRP VBP NP . PRP VBP .
JJS IN NP , we are IN NP , IN S .
they &apos;re going to VB NP .
RB VBG NP .
NN VBZ NP . NN VBZ NP . NN VBZ NP .
she came RB , saw IN NP and said , &quot; NP VP .
NP CC NP -- NP NP .
we would have no access IN NP or IN NP TO VP .
and of course consider NP SBAR IN NP IN NP .
very od@@ d -- i &apos;ve analy@@ zed NP PP .
and i thought IN NP IN NP .
you have , IN NP , lost NP SBAR .
except IN S have DT JJ NN like NP VP .
we should look at how NP PP VBP NP .
my dad actually res@@ ig@@ ned from NP PP because NP VP .
PRP VP , VP . &quot;
NN NNS IN NP . DT NN IN NP .
many of them are working in NP : NP , NP , NP , ADVP .
NP , NP VBZ VP .
this is the term WDT NP VP .
NP VP , so NP VP .
we created the respon@@ sive room WRB NP VP .
normally we think IN NP IN ADJP .
with human@@ i@@ zed technology we can monit@@ or NP PP .
ar@@ iel garten : know NN , IN NP
so let NP ADVP VP , the great part of DT IN NP ?
and with the same do@@ g@@ ged determin@@ ation that my father had b@@ red into me since NP VP -- NP VP , S VP , NP VP , and NP VP , and NP VP .
and you all know WP NP VP . you don NP VP .
S , NP VBP NP VP ? &quot;
and i didn NP VP .
NP VP , so NP VP .
and i set up kan@@ ch@@ i , because NP VP .
and stop with NP , NP .
the reason , i think , is that the pen@@ sion@@ ers believe PRP NP VP , whereas NP VP .
do you call it the ba@@ il@@ out of NN or the ba@@ il@@ out of NP PP which l@@ ent IN NP ?
and i think that NP ADVP ADVP .
everybody else at NP PP , more or less , was trying VP .
if you &apos;re on the way VP , you &apos;d probably pre@@ fer to stay IN NP .
ADVP VP NP , and ADVP VP NP .
i would argue , in britain there &apos;s a much better frame of re@@ ference , which is to tell people that NP VP .
and within that context , we can offer NP : NP .
hi . so , this cha@@ p here , he thinks he can VB NP NP .
these drugs were brought to market . they were pres@@ cri@@ bed very wid@@ ely because NN NNS VBP NP , and it took so long for us to find out that NP ADVP VP that before we dete@@ cted that NP VP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
and the most st@@ ag@@ ger@@ ing thing of DT IN NP is that not only VBZ NP .
nasa suppor@@ ted this work 12 years ago IN NP so that NP VP .
NP VP , and NP NP .
so , with the mit media lab , for quite a while now , we &apos;ve been enga@@ ged in NP VP .
so we know , for NN , that NP VP .
NP VP and NP VP . PRP VBZ NP .
RB , ADVP IN NP , VBP NP VP ?
do they provide NN IN NP VP ? and , NP VP , that &apos;s DT JJ NN IN NP . so , you know , IN NP , S .
do you remember NP CC NP ?
SBAR , NP VP , NP VP , NP VP .
it has NP SBAR .
on average , it was just DT ADJP NN IN NP WDT NP VP .
NP VP and NP VP .
yes , this person reti@@ red IN NP .
and IN NP NP PP , everything is IN ADJP .
and just for ki@@ cks we ran his picture through NP , NP TO VP .
also , those very sounds tend not to be repres@@ ented IN NP .
even in NP NP , this life expec@@ tan@@ cy gap is as much as 20 years .
in NN , for NN , there were RB IN NP .
for me , what &apos;s truly s@@ und@@ ar about the idea of task shif@@ ting , though , isn &apos; t that NP ADVP VP but that NP VP .
we began the project with an inter@@ im report , which quickly pulled together a lot of information that had been colle@@ cted IN NP IN NP .
but when did DT NN ADVP ADVP VB NP NP ?
now i &apos;m going to show you WRB NP VP .
SBAR , NP VP , but INTJ , NP VP .
and the chinese government respon@@ ded RB and placed DT NN IN NP .
it &apos;s IN NP .
we &apos;ve actually ADVP VBD NP PP PP not VB NP .
but the man had NP PP IN NP .
JJ VBD NP .
but it was RB JJ .
we were up in NP , NP .
but he was very excited that NP VP .
he would try to VB NP , gui@@ ded IN NP .
if NP VP , you would VB NP .
how should we really honor NN ?
PRP VBZ NP .
ADVP NP VP -- and NP VP .
and despite DT IN NP , kids are always going VP S , IN NP they can .
NP ADVP VP , and NP VP .
it &apos;s a very simple exercise -- buy DT NN IN NP , write PRP IN NP , RB ri@@ p NP PP and play PRP IN NP .
so this motiv@@ ated me to become an or@@ th@@ op@@ edi@@ c surge@@ on and to see if NP VP .
well the reason is because NP VP .
RB IN NP NP RB RB .
and it wouldn NP VP .
more tomorrow . i also have NP VP .
so hopefully tomorrow i &apos;ll show one or two more objects from the stage , but for today i just wanted to say thank you for all the people that came and talked IN NP IN NP .
but i brought along here NP PP -- ADVP , NP PP .
WRB NP VP , pretty much looked IN NP .
but they want VP .
we &apos;re also working IN NP VP .
i said NP VP , we can spread it out TO VP .
i have NP PP .
getting PRP IN ADVP ?
so i exist some@@ what outside IN NP .
to this end , i have worked IN NP IN NP .
for some reason , i thought NP VP .
&quot; NP VP , but NP VP .
and it &apos;s very , very common for designers and people in DT JJ NNS to feel that NP VP , that all NP VP is contribu@@ ting IN NP .
re@@ zero kee@@ ps his balance by constantly meas@@ uring PRP$ NN NN IN NP .
with a screen it could VB NP or VB NP ADVP PP .
and so , going back to this ab@@ alone sh@@ ell , bes@@ i@@ des being nano - structured , one thing that &apos;s fascinating , is when a male and a female ab@@ alone get together , NP VP , &quot; NP VP .
the ab@@ alone sh@@ ell here -- and if NP VP , you can look IN NP IN S .
it took them about 50 million years to learn how to perfect how to VB NP .
PRP VBD NP ADVP .
angel@@ a bel@@ cher : VBG NP S
and then you &apos;ll hear things like NP , NP , NP -- RB , the com@@ mu@@ te .
and what you find is that , especially with NP : NP : that people really need NP PP VP .
why do we expect people to work well if NP VP ?
DT VBZ NP . PRP VBZ NP .
NP VP , what are NP SBAR ?
SBAR , NP VP , but NP VP ?
NP VP ; NP VP .
DT VBZ NP . PRP VBZ ADVP .
i mean , i couldn &apos; t take your phones off PRP if NP VP .
PRP VBP , NP .
so , we &apos;ve been conduc@@ ting NP PP .
it brings ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ary ban@@ king services to places WRB NP VP .
like , this is vi@@ a@@ gr@@ a that i bought IN NP IN NP .
for me , this kind of person@@ i@@ fi@@ es this connected world , where NP VP , and NP VP -- it &apos;s all about the dots jo@@ ining together .
and , IN NP , VBZ NP IN NP .
our reality right now is less interesting than the story NP VP .
WP VBD NP VP ?
de@@ an or@@ nis@@ h shares new research that shows WRB VP can affect a person at a genetic level . for instance , he says , WRB NP VP , VB NP and VB NP , your brain cells actually increase .
NP VP : NP VP ; SBAR VP . &quot;
these are NP SBAR .
but it turns out that NP VP .
make NP VP . make NP VP . &quot;
because of course , sometimes we do make decisions that VP , CC PP NP , and PP , NP .
WRB NP VP they like WHADVP S .
VBP NP .
NN IN NP gave IN NP .
and RB RB , DT JJ NN VBD NP .
NP-TMP NP VP , and PP NP VP .
recently we did NP PP PP IN NP .
that &apos;s IN NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
DT NNS VBP NP .
but an amazing alternative energy company in paris is taking us off NP PP .
DT VBD NP .
this young man is VBG NP .
and together these volunte@@ ers and the teachers are deeply commit@@ ted to creating NP PP .
is this do@@ able IN NP ?
cha@@ z e@@ bert : it was cha@@ z who stood IN NP IN NP VP .
then i tried VBG NP PP and VBG NP .
they &apos;d never made CD IN NP .
people who VBP NP should know that NP ADVP VP .
the initi@@ als stood IN NP .
now we live IN NP .
sometimes they assu@@ me NP VP .
a guy goes IN NP .
RB WP MD NP VP ?
other examples NP VP are from NP : NP .
so first you ask a big question : WRB NP VP ? what is the goal ?
you will rec@@ all IN S like really told that NP VP ?
she ended RP IN NP .
and i ended up with NP , NP CC NP .
so they eventually started mat@@ ching their tal@@ ents and skills to NP PP .
so i moved on IN ADVP .
and as a blind person , your visual memory fa@@ des and is re@@ placed with WRB NP VP and WRB NP VP and WRB NP VP .
and he wrote IN NP IN NP , VP .
and i think NP , ADVP , NP .
but i wanted VP .
so i &apos;m VP VP NP .
RB NP PP VBP NP .
let &apos;s do a ro@@ tation by NP PP an@@ tic@@ lo@@ ck@@ wise , and refle@@ ct in NP PP .
but the shapes match up if NP VP .
well , unfortunately it isn &apos; t really a picture . if NP VP , great , exc@@ ell@@ ent .
two ? so you should VB VP .
i &apos;ve learned that NP VP .
but i think from the point of NN IN NP , there would have been a lot of NN IN NP .
and NP ADVP VP .
CC NP VP , but NP VP .
NN IN NP , IN NP .
IN NP , S , EX VBZ NP .
here &apos;s something that dri@@ ves NP ADJP .
PRP VBP NP NP-TMP .
and instead of DT NN and VP CC VP , things colli@@ de as NP VP . just like on my real des@@ k , i can -- let NP ADVP VP -- i can turn NNS IN NP .
i think NP VP .
let NP VP .
PRP VBP NP SBAR , and NP VP , and NP VP .
and i said , &quot; what &apos;s NP PP ? &quot;
and the ga@@ g is IN , IN NP , NP VP .
and the thing is , is IN NP JJ NN NN .
we &apos;re designing IN NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
NP ADJP ?
NNS : VBZ NP .
CD NN IN NP happen IN NP .
add that ADVP IN NP , and NP VP .
when people come to an un@@ familiar situation they don &apos; t know how to deal with NP VP .
for example , meas@@ les was NP PP ADVP IN NP and now is IN NP .
and more recently you can see NP VP .
and that &apos;s WRB NP VP .
i can say that , even though NP VP .
RB , WRB VBP NP VP ?
you might think NP VP .
and the whole spirit and at@@ titude in those schools is very different than IN NP .
and that allows NP VP .
you know , the system doesn &apos; t naturally make NP VP .
NP VP but NP VP , and DT VBZ S .
NP VP , and NP VP . S , CC S , PRP VBP VP .
i &apos;ll find a way to get in , because i don NP VP . &quot;
how many of you are completely comfortable with VBG NP NP ?
&quot; and i felt so bad IN NP WDT NP VP , and as soon as NP VP , you got DT ADJP NN IN NP and you looked IN NP , and you said , NP PP . look at that .
we need to get over it so NP VP , and our little brothers and our little si@@ sters , and one day our kids -- or our kids right now -- can watch and start to value the impact NP VP lives NP PP and NP CC NP .
so no@@ wa@@ days in the operating room , we no longer need to VB NP .
RB if NP VP , it &apos;s DT NN RB .
DT NN VP CC VP .
and then if NP VP , the woman would VB PP S .
in DT NN IN NP , IN IN CD percent of NP PP may have NP CC NP .
RB RB VBZ DT NN .
i &apos;d like to leave PRP IN NP .
and this cell is CD IN NP that NP VP .
but electricity also will go in NP : NP .
and because it &apos;s a protein , it &apos;s en@@ co@@ ded for in NP PP .
so if we could figure out WP NP VP , we could maybe find new tar@@ gets IN WHNP NP VP , or maybe places WRB NP VP .
and the animal &apos;s going to hear NP : CC NP occur@@ red there .
maybe 100,000 people have co@@ ch@@ le@@ ar im@@ plants , which allow NP VP .
and NP , PP , IN NP is VP .
and IN S , PRP VBZ ADVP NP .
and PRP RB VBD NP .
VBP NP .
there were no cars , so NP VP .
ADVP NP VP , NP VP , and NP VP .
NP VP ; NP VP .
so basically , the number of pages that mention this term , that also mention NP , NP VBZ NP &apos;s google share of that term .
they &apos;re talking IN NP .
if NP VP , most people link IN NP .
we are increasingly off@@ ered NP SBAR .
and the speed with which they associ@@ ate it with NP CC NP spea@@ ks to the en@@ during nature .
and the stories NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
can oper@@ a be ever - so - slightly sex@@ y ? the gl@@ ori@@ ous sop@@ ran@@ o dan@@ i@@ elle de ni@@ ese shows how , VBG NP . NN WHNP , transl@@ ated , means , as NP VP . &quot; from NN IN NP ; ac@@ compan@@ ist : ing@@ rid sur@@ gen@@ or .
commer@@ ce , on the other hand , is relatively quick , essentially creative , highly effective and efficient , and fundament@@ ally honest , because we can &apos; t exchange value for very long if NP VP .
ADVP NP VP and NP VP .
the upp@@ er is n@@ yl@@ on 6 that can go back to NP , NP , NP -- infin@@ itely recycl@@ able ther@@ m@@ op@@ la@@ stic .
when VBN , they said , &quot; NP VP . &quot;
and we have pl@@ ent@@ y of NN , so NP VP , but NP VP .
NNS IN NP , WRB NP VP , the bot@@ tom@@ s are ADJP NNS .
because S CC S , WP NP VP , effectively , WRB NP VP , was VBN NP .
and then the com@@ post is NP VP -- VP .
this is NP JJR .
we didn NP VP . we didn NP VP .
RB PRP VBP NP .
all right , how many NP CC NP VBP , every day , u.s. - based services , like , you know , run NNS CC NN , or VB NP , or VB NP PP , or RB VB NP PP ?
and who@@ ever tells you that NP VP hasn &apos; t thought about this long enough .
she was NP PP .
humans have long held NP PP .
and what PRP MD VP is NP VP . you see NP RBR structure there .
we get one from NP , NP .
and PP , NP VP -- NP VP -- and NP VP .
you can see on the microscop@@ e slide here , that &apos;s what &apos;s happening IN NP .
green is NP RB JJ NNS WRB NP VP .
so if you &apos;re IN NP , for example , you can go through NP PP TO VP .
NP NP , but NP VP .
RB WRB VBZ NP ?
the thing is , if we don S , we are not any better than NP CC NP .
&quot; if PRP VBP NP PP , people are not going VP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
and then you make it easy and give a reason to act now by ad@@ ding NP PP .
the third one is important because if NP VP , it might VB NP S .
you know how TO VP , you know how to VB NP . &quot;
VB NP NP .
but look WP NP ADVP VP .
and now , maybe , we can go back to the bigger question that i started with IN NP .
we &apos;ve NP VP .
and that has to do IN NP IN S .
so let NP VP .
so the very definition -- to say NP VP .
but looking IN NP sa@@ chs CD NN -- NP VP .
DT NN RB VBD PRT NP-TMP .
it &apos;s more expensive VP . NNS IN NP go RB , inf@@ lation is affected .
PRP VBZ NP .
it also provi@@ des a third of the food NP VP .
we so r@@ ar@@ ely look IN NP .
so this is the foot@@ age WDT NP VP .
okay .
ADVP NP VP , and NP VP .
it was , inci@@ dent@@ ally , the last time NP ADVP VP .
and he said , &quot; because NP VP to do IN NP . &quot;
how could somebody read VP ?
NNP : UH .
kb : just don NP VP .
PRP VBP NP S .
ok , now , do you believe IN NP IN NP ?
kb : WP VBD NP VP ?
ok , now , allow NP VP .
and VB NP ADVP , VB NP ADVP , NP , VB NP ADVP .
come right IN ADVP , next IN NP .
and i want NP VP .
PRP VBD !
they &apos;ll keep an eye on me to make sure NP VP .
s@@ j : you &apos;re IN NP .
do you think NP VP ?
that &apos;s not good . hi . yeah . real bad . don &apos; t even look IN NP .
you know that when you have those ab@@ u@@ sive voices , all those little neurons get together and in that little gap you get a real tox@@ ic &quot; i want to kill NP NP , and if you have that over and over again on a loo@@ p ta@@ pe , you might have yourself depression .
we are not equi@@ pped IN NP .
we need to know WRB NP VP .
but it was RB JJ .
and in that pair , one person gets a message saying , &quot; do you want to give up DT IN NP and ship it to NP PP ? &quot;
so to VB NP , i knew NP VP .
so if PRP VBP NP , i feel that NP .
VB NP S .
now there are other ways NP VP .
the bri@@ de .
so there &apos;s NP PP WDT NP VP , and it seems VP .
i tried to look at where did the kind of learning NP VP , where did it come from ?
and you have NP SBAR .
NP PP MD VP . &quot;
RB NP NP , and NP VP .
i came RB IN NP and said , &quot; NP VP . &quot;
kal@@ lik@@ upp@@ am had caught RP IN NP IN NP , NP PP .
NP , SBAR , SBAR , NP VP , NP VP , NP VP .
you can &apos; NP VP .
you already heard about DT . you know WP NP VP .
it &apos;s NP SBAR .
NP VP , and NP VP ? ! WP VP ? ! &quot;
if NP VP ...
this qu@@ and@@ ary led to the ti@@ tle of the project , which consi@@ ders in many ways that we are NP VP and that PRP IN NP represent NP PP .
and i found these maps WDT NP VP .
so they &apos;re VBG NP .
NN VBD PRT .
NP PP NN RB IN NP .
this is RB NP PP .
there NNS NN RB JJ IN NP .
and you feel really quite -- believe it or not -- deta@@ ched IN NP and IN NP , even though i &apos;m actually holding the stick quite ti@@ ghtly .
they &apos;re RB JJ .
exactly . because NP VP .
in NP SBAR , it could VB NP .
however , RB CD IN NP got IN IN NP VP , VP ! how can PRP cla@@ p ? ok , maybe ...
and interest@@ ingly , the older S , CC S DT IN NP went IN IN NP .
IN NP , NP SBAR VBD NP .
and it got big enough to the point where there was a flo@@ at NP VP , and NP VP , and ri@@ ck@@ roll@@ s millions of people on television .
but that &apos;s not what &apos;s interesting IN NP .
got DT NN NNS IN NP .
but there were NP SBAR .
and they were probably pleas@@ ed to see you on NN IN NP .
dinosau@@ r evolution proce@@ e@@ ded at NP , NP RBR on NP SBAR .
a three - and HYPH NP thing , beautiful sk@@ ul@@ l , predat@@ or , meat - eater , a two - legged animal .
NP : NP VP -- NP VP .
it turns out to have NP ADJP IN NP .
NN VBP NP .
and then work later is going to VB NP to ti@@ bet .
ADVP NP VP , but NP VP .
PRP VBP NP .
you have VP . if NP VP -- it &apos;s JJ S .
PRP VBP NP NP .
NP VP ; NP VP .
there &apos;s not DT JJ NN IN NP and there never has been .
NP VP , and RB ADVP NP VP .
PRP VBP NP S .
and what happened was NP VP , &quot; called running shoes .
but RB RB VBZ NP ADVP .
PP , NP VP ; NP VP .
PRP VBZ NP .
NP VP , PRP VBZ NP PP ! NP VP , or VBZ NP ?
NP VP -- NP VP .
to explore that question , we did a study in the boston area where we put CD IN NP in NP NP for NP PP .
but we can VB NP ADVP .
robots touch something deeply human IN NP .
and i can &apos; NP VP .
and i followed this guy everywhere until PRP VBD NP PP , and NP VP , and NP VP ?
NP VP , and NP VP .
NP ADVP VP , so NP VP .
UH , RB VBZ NP .
so , all this work is getting shown IN NP .
this image is quite interesting , actually , because NP VP .
WP NP VP ... he had NP UCP NP NP .
has anyone here wonder@@ ed what will happen if NP VP , and NP VP ?
that is something VP . we can &apos; NN NN IN NP IN NP .
PRP VBP NP ADVP -- NP VP , NP VP .
and we will VB NP .
NP VP , PRP VBP S .
we &apos;re S : NP , NP , NP . now , with DT NN IN NP , it gives people motivation .
and i actually feel at NN here , because NP VP .
my dra@@ wings got to NN IN NP too .
and the way NP VP , i showed off NNS IN NP .
i was really concerned about having to wear DT NN IN NP .
i find NP VP .
he was RB NP PP .
and WRB NP VP , i had NP PP .
because what i &apos;m VP is the good teachers , for a lot of these kids , are out in the community colle@@ ges , but we need to be getting NP PP IN NP .
what are you most passionate IN ?
now my own speci@@ ality is VBG NP .
NN HYPH NN .
and it was deep . it was deep IN NP .
now there &apos;s DT NN IN NP .
and now the sh@@ ore is coming , and there &apos;s NP PP WHNP S .
VBP NP .
the first problem is NP VP .
they send NP VP .
i think NP VP .
WP MD NP VP ?
and so they invented the scientific journ@@ al as NP PP .
DT NNS VBP CC VBP .
NP VP and NP VP .
right .
it was NP PP .
this one NP VP show you .
mor@@ gan hen@@ dry : be@@ ware IN NP is an instru@@ mental rock band .
so we literally are NP VP .
and if you look IN NP , you see a little teen@@ y dark do@@ t .
UH , PRP VBP VP .
NNP : NP VP .
that &apos;s when NP VP , and NP VP .
ADVP NP VP , ADVP NP VP , or NP VP , know IN NP NP PP , WHNP S .
but also , if NP VP , we have NP SBAR .
so as we fle@@ w IN ADVP IN NP , we looked back . and guess what ?
NP ADVP VP , and NP VP .
so if we start VP , we can see WRB NP VP .
we have the ability to VB NP PP .
and of course , there &apos;s NP PP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
how about VP ?
so a few examples : we &apos;re now in DT NN IN NP , &quot; the i@@ p@@ ill .
in NP ADVP , NP PP about 10 years ago WRB NP VP .
NP VP ; NP VP ; and ADVP , NP VP .
we &apos;ve been actually using NP PP .
the first one is de@@ dic@@ ated IN NP .
in those days there was still coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side close to NP , NP ; RB RB far IN NP NP VP you could pre@@ tend S .
the girl , my old love , the last lost time NP VP , her RB st@@ um@@ bling , fall@@ ing , spra@@ w@@ ling , sk@@ ir@@ t VP , eyes v@@ ein@@ ed red , s@@ wollen with NP , NP , NP .
this is VBN NP . &quot;
a cas@@ ual impul@@ se , a fan@@ cy , never thought of IN NP ...
NP , PP , VBD NP .
c@@ .@@ k. willi@@ ams : NN IN NP
NP VP , and NP VP . &quot;
but images don NP VP .
WP NP VP , in NP SBAR , is VP . WHNP NP VP , WRB ?
DT VBD NP .
two nor@@ we@@ gi@@ ans did PRP IN NP IN NP . no one &apos;s VBN NP ADVP .
WRB NP VP , i could RB RB VB NP .
NP , NP -- CC NP VP .
i took NP PP . sat RP IN NP . did NP PP .
NP VP , PRP VBD SBAR .
this is probably why i didn NP VP .
since then , no one has ever ski@@ ed -- this was 9@@ 3 years ago -- since then , no one has ever ski@@ ed IN NP IN NP and back .
but NP VP , so NP VP . &quot;
and i remem@@ ber@@ ed that NP VP and NP VP .
i do want to leave PRP IN NP .
but what if NP VP ?
NP VP , and SBAR , NP VP .
what would happen IN NP ?
the no@@ ve@@ list v@@ la@@ di@@ mir n@@ abo@@ ko@@ v said that NP VP .
i &apos;m NP JJ RB RB .
therefore , they asked their parents to go RP IN NP and collect NP , VP .
and while this was NP PP IN S it was true -- that NP VP , and NP VP .
i remember one night when someone ph@@ oned me on my cell@@ phone -- ordinary person who i don NP VP -- from ta@@ hri@@ r square .
is this NP , NP or NP NP ?
they &apos;ve VP .
and frank@@ ie says , &quot; PRP VBP NP , and NP VP , and NP VP .
you don NP VP .
so what we &apos;ve been doing IN NP is re@@ vie@@ wing the data -- end@@ less@@ ly re@@ vie@@ wing the data .
they are NP PP .
but it is changing the equ@@ ation of what &apos;s rational IN NP .
WP VBZ NP VP ?
NP VP , and NP VP .
and i &apos;d pull PRP RP IN NP .
it &apos;s called claw - hammer style , that he had learned IN NP .
it sounds NN IN NP .
we were standing IN NP .
now , my mother hop@@ ed that NP VP .
JJ NN : NP VP .
but then , when i thought IN NP IN NP , it was very simple things .
and we moved IN NP IN NP .
they said NP VP .
so let me put them all together . and also , i can change the sounds by ste@@ pping IN NP RB RB , and -- let me just close out here by doing NP NP .
not only is there DT NN IN NP of VP , but there has been NP PP .
and mer@@ ging them together TO VP , is the cul@@ min@@ ation of NP , NP .
now , darwin taught us that there are processes of self - organization that suff@@ ice to explain NP CC NP .
IN NP , PRP VBP VP . NN MD ADVP VP .
i can VB NP PP . i do PRP IN NP .
so i looked IN NP .
NP VP , PP , NP VP .
what came IN IN NP ?
there is NP VP .
these are some pictures NP VP .
and NP PP VBD , ADVP , S .
so even as NP VP , it &apos;s not experienced DT JJ NN NP IN .
and it &apos;s also DT NN IN NP .
but i see something pro@@ fo@@ und@@ ly transforma@@ tive in experi@@ en@@ cing death as NP CC NP .
NP PP -- VBP NP PP .
but you do meet NP , NP .
&quot; i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;ve only got 18 minutes , 18 minutes to talk about VP , VP , NP .
why would you do that ? why would -- it &apos;s like one step up from re@@ pl@@ ying IN NP , NP NP ?
but PRP VBP NP . PRP VBP NP .
and he spoke IN NP IN NP , S , NP IN S
do you remember that ? george bush , &quot; NP VP HYPH NP . &quot;
&quot; NP VP .
and there &apos;s NNS IN NP .
and so every time they found something that looked a little different , PRP VBD NP NP different .
they don &apos; t like PRP if NP VP .
ADVP NP VP and NP VP .
what &apos;s interesting is the spi@@ ke on DT NN IN NP was growing very fast as well .
and then , because NP VP , i VBD S and VB ADVP .
RB VB NP .
now as PRP MD VP , this is not very popular IN NP .
and it &apos;s a respon@@ sive system that &apos;s trained IN NP .
anyway , moving RB .
so , un@@ fol@@ ded NP VP .
the view is den@@ i@@ ed IN NP .
S , NP VP , PRP VBP NP .
and this is a mo@@ ck@@ up that is in s@@ alt la@@ ke city that VBZ NP NP .
even IN NP , men get NP PP .
what she found VP tend to VB NP and VB NP .
VBG NP ADVP made NP ADJP .
she was the c@@ bs NP VP .
the bot@@ an@@ ical names are IN NP .
NP VP , NN VBD NP .
p@@ m : RB RB NP NP .
and so that happened more at various times , but i really think that NP VP .
RB VBG NP , i decided VP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
RB , UH .
great news . it dri@@ ves me nu@@ ts that most people don NP VP .
now i know that some of PRP think NP VP -- and who doesn NP VP ? -- but look at sub-@@ sahar@@ an africa .
right now today , in o@@ sl@@ o as NP VP , oil companies are fighting TO VP .
IN S , NP VP and NP VP .
so now , if NP VP , you have VP .
NP VP , and PP , NP VP .
so , this is normal dna , what you think of IN NP .
NP VP , NP VP , NP VP , and SBAR , NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP &apos;s JJS NN , NN ?
NP VP , and SBAR , NP VP .
and SBAR , NP VP , but NP VP .
and i think in the next five or 10 years , we &apos;ll make NP PP and maybe even get IN NP .
when life brought NP PP IN NP medical response service in NN , similar to NP PP .
yet , if NP VP , he or she does not VP CC VP , VP , VP . &quot;
it can be worth up to one trillion dollars , being paid in NP , CC NP .
NP PP RB VP , VP , CC VP . &quot;
RB NP SBAR VBZ NP , and PRP MD VP , WRB VBP NP VP , WP VBP NP VP .
so as we go in RB , what we start to VP , VP , we see what &apos;s NP VP .
well here &apos;s CD IN NP JJ IN NP .
ma@@ sc@@ ul@@ in@@ ity mi@@ mi@@ cked by men who grew up with NP , NP but need hu@@ gs .
VB , VB , VB . &quot;
a wise person knows how to impro@@ v@@ ise , as NP VP .
all NP VP was NP NP , WHNP S .
we can certainly see NP PP IN NP .
don NP VP . we need NNS !
all NP VP , &quot; WP VP ? &quot;
be proud that NP VP .
so there &apos;s NP PP , VP .
if PRP VBP NP , the rest is just pretty much a coast down@@ h@@ ill .
they have NP PP .
they &apos;ve been VBG NP . &quot;
NP VP , SBAR , NP VP and NP VP .
i &apos;ll give you some a@@ sto@@ unding things that have happened as NP VP .
he was le@@ an@@ ing IN NP .
and NP VP and NP VP .
NP VP what am PRP VBG S ?
PRP VBZ NP .
it &apos;s the path@@ fin@@ der that VBZ NP NP .
the earth moved IN NP .
there was RB JJ NNS , NP PP , that NP VP .
ADVP , NP VP , and NP VP how could i do DT ?
and then there is NN NN .
PRP VBZ NP . PRP VBZ NP .
DT VBD NP .
and WP NP VP he VBD PP , and VBD NP .
which was making NP ADJP .
it was JJ .
i was IN NP ? &quot;
now what we can do is point at NP PP and immediately get the bul@@ le@@ tin .
teacher : now move NP NP . see WP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
PP , NP VP , NP VP , NP VP , NP VP .
last week , bill clin@@ ton at the ted a@@ wards said , &quot; NP VP . &quot;
JJ IN NP , NP VP , have RB VBN ADVP .
we &apos;ve seen NP PP .
it is something VP .
and WRB NP VP , they VBD NP PP and VBN NP .
ADVP NP NP SBAR .
well , they &apos;ve ADVP VP that gene , that NP , and put it into NN NNS .
so even as NP VP , we have allowed PRP VP .
and it rais@@ es the question of how we &apos;re going to define animal species in NP PP -- a question that NP VP yet how to solve .
we &apos;ve taken away DT NN IN NP . &quot;
this is NP VP .
we are directly designing NP PP .
and he went on to say , &quot; NP VP . &quot;
but NP ADVP , VBD PP .
there was NP PP .
so we have , in NP , NP WDT ADVP VP .
you , you can VB NP .
so let NP VP .
IN NP , PRP VBD NP .
why RB ? because , in NN , DT NN IN NP is NP ADJP .
UH , PRP VBP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
so the idea there was that NP VP -- how do you say ? -- model price vari@@ ation .
it &apos;s RB JJ .
JJ NN : NP CC NP
so , imagine that NP VP .
here &apos;s an example of the puzz@@ le NP VP .
RB , NP VP , and ADVP NP VP .
right ? DT NN IN NP &apos;s NN , IN NP .
ADVP NP VP but PP , NP VP .
did our farmers turn IN NP ?
to VB NP NP , ethi@@ op@@ ian ma@@ ize farmers produced CD NNS IN NP .
in the american mid@@ west , farmers used to VB NP PP and VB NP NP PP .
that means that NP VP .
we believe that NP VP , but that NP VP .
NP VP , ADVP NP , ADVP ADJP .
that &apos;s a potential scen@@ ari@@ o if NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
then , QP NNS after@@ wards , VBG NP , NP JJ IN NN IN NP .
it &apos;s NP , CC NP .
i paid to get NP VP -- then it broke again .
if NP VP , then the impli@@ cations are JJ .
he &apos;s bar@@ e@@ foot . he &apos;ll run back into PRP$ NN , and he will cont@@ amin@@ ate NP CC NP and NP PP S .
we don NP VP .
and you might think NP VP , but NP VP , because NP VP .
she grew up in a rural village in a poor area of NN , and she was enga@@ ged IN NP , and RB IN NP or so , she moved into NP PP house .
PRP VBZ ADVP NP .
and that was WP NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP - VP , SBAR .
and we tra@@ w@@ l , which means to VB NP NP , put it on a big chain , and dra@@ g it across the sea floor to VB PRT NP and VB NP .
but since NP VP and NP VP , there &apos;s NN VP and there &apos;s NP PP , so NP VP .
and ADVP , PP , NP VP , and NP ADVP VP .
but there are these , what we call , JJ NP , NP .
in NP VP , coral re@@ e@@ f ec@@ ologist jer@@ e@@ my j@@ ack@@ son la@@ ys IN NP . ast@@ on@@ ishing photos and stat@@ s make DT NN .
that &apos;s -- that NP ADJP .
that NP VP .
i went IN NP NP , SBAR .
the sand@@ wor@@ ms were JJ , CC NP ?
does something seem strange IN NP to PRP ?
she was NP PP to go IN NP she did not know or had never seen .
she was s@@ mil@@ ing . she did not understand WRB NP VP .
but i think NP VP .
jo@@ se@@ ph sch@@ um@@ peter called NP VP . &quot;
is this RB WRB NP VP ? &quot;
WP VBZ NP ?
what VBZ NP PP ?
but it &apos;s also clear that NP VP .
NP VP , JJ NN VBD NP NP-TMP . good news !
i pain@@ ted it directly on NN IN NP .
i made the tough decision of going home after gradu@@ ation and not going up to capit@@ ol h@@ ill , but going down to NP NP and making it my job to learn how to paint .
WRB NP VP , and WRB NP VP , i couldn NP VP .
and PRP VBZ NP PP , and NP VP , and NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
okay , so the politics of NN are very moral IN NP .
S , NP VP -- NP VP .
IN NP , PRP VBZ VP .
NP VP -- NP ADVP VP .
WP NP VP is NP PP .
DT VBZ NP .
PRP VBP VP .
now you &apos;d think that NP VP .
and NP VP , and NP VP .
and IN NP NP PP VBD NP .
we want NP VP .
after PRP VBD NP , le@@ wi@@ s pu@@ gh vo@@ wed never TO VP . then he heard IN NP IN NP IN NP -- and so began NP SBAR .
DT VBZ NP . DT VBZ NP .
i thought about NP PP that NP VP , but can we do similar things ?
ADVP NP VP : MD NP VP .
and literally with NP : NP : you can define NP PP , PP PP , IN PP .
but they can show you how to build NNS IN NP .
NP VP , but ADVP , NP VP .
and the cor@@ relation , of course , is that den@@ ser places tend VP -- which isn NP NP , IN S .
this is a ma@@ p@@ ni@@ fi@@ cent map that shows me , in this case , how far i can get IN NP IN NP .
which brings on another th@@ res@@ hold effect NP VP , you save a whole bunch of money up front .
IN NP , NP VP , and SBAR , NP VP .
according IN NP , since CD , in NP CC NP , there has VBN NP , ADVP PP . worldwide , there &apos;s VBN NP . the yellow b@@ ars here show NP PP IN NP IN NP .
so that &apos;s NP PP .
PP , NP VP , but NP ADVP VP .
now these are not the kinds of things that someone is thinking about RB before NP VP .
and WP VBZ NP ADVP ? VB NP ?
PRP VBP NP . PRP VBP NP .
NP VP and NP VP .
and asia could have social development before NP VP .
but RBR CC RBR , NP VP , and NP VP .
and RB PRP VBZ NP NP-TMP , ADVP .
and we had NP PP .
the middle income countries , the emerging economy , NP VP .
NP PP VBP VP .
it &apos;s caused IN NP IN NP .
and PRP VBP NP . VBP NP ADVP .
RB JJS NN IN NP .
NP VP , but PP , NP VP .
and i would say NP VP .
it &apos;s when people &apos;s NP VP .
i think it &apos;s NP PP . that &apos;s the long - term goal .
NP VP , NP ADJP .
but equ@@ ally , it has NP CC NP .
well , since NP VP , it appe@@ ars IN S .
well , because it VBZ NP NP , or , PP , NP .
governments are not VBG NP . why ?
there were 5@@ 6 , and when our president wanted to VB NP and VB NP , he had to create 25 new distri@@ cts , and now there are 8@@ 1 .
doctor se@@ li@@ g@@ man , what is NP PP NN ? &quot;
and the conclu@@ sion of DT is that NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP ?
so i want to say a little bit about each of those lives and what we know IN NP .
WRB NP VP , time st@@ ops IN NP . and it st@@ ops IN NP .
and meaning , in this view , consi@@ sts of -- ADJP IN NP -- NP VP .
so , the JJ S thing NP VP is NP VP .
but they were JJ .
these are NP VP .
now i have VP , i was talking IN NP JJ NN IN NP .
a li@@ on having a late night s@@ n@@ ack -- notice NP VP got a broken to@@ oth .
for NP PP , more people live IN NP .
NP VP -- NP VP .
but then paul got IN NP .
david gri@@ ff@@ in : WRB NP VP
so , if we use information that comes off of this spe@@ cular refle@@ ction , we can go from a traditional face scan that might have the gro@@ ss cont@@ ours of the face and the basic shape , and aug@@ ment it with information that puts in all of NP CC NP .
we can turn DT NN IN NP IN S .
WP NP VP was , S , NN and WDT NP VP , bring PRP IN NP VP .
ADVP NP VP , but PP NP VP .
you can &apos; NP VP .
and that was NP PP .
and they can &apos; NP VP .
and one day , we went IN NP .
i op@@ pose it -- that NP VP , until NP VP and then i see the ch@@ ie@@ f com@@ man@@ der .
see what NP PP .
building capac@@ i@@ ties for the young generation is going to make NP CC NP NN IN NP .
did you know that , PP , NP VP ?
let NP VP .
UH , after NP VP .
for NP PP , we s@@ hr@@ ink IN NP .
some of NP PP are not really very contro@@ versi@@ al .
the ver@@ tical axis now is NP PP .
all the rest went IN NP .
that comes out at NP PP .
you have to choose CC NP CC NP .
and some people would say that NP VP .
everything except rand@@ om@@ ness . she did not believe IN NP .
and that &apos;s what i look for in NP , NP .
but , NP : VP : IN NP they had VP .
it may be NP , NP .
well , what is JJ ? what is NN ? what is NN ?
i was able to see that in a fir@@ sth@@ and way , when i went IN NP , IN NP .
i believe IN NP .
and the reason is that until NP VP , no one wanted PRP .
right . NP VP ; NP VP ; NP VP .
who &apos;s going to VP CC VP -- oh , look , a co@@ w . nobody .
they turned DT NN IN NP , IN NP .
talk IN NP and make NP ADJP S .
am@@ ih@@ ot@@ or@@ not@@ .com -- everyday 25@@ 0,000 people go to NP , VP , and i can VB NP SBAR NP , and they didn NP VP .
silk . put a product that does not need to be IN NP ADVP IN NP .
in DT NN IN NP , our obvious choice is TO ADVP VP . marketing gur@@ u se@@ th go@@ d@@ in sp@@ ells out WRB , SBAR , NP VP .
now , speaking of walls , i want to share IN NP NP PP .
NP PP VBP VP .
if NP VP , i think IN S .
the problem is that NP VP .
we can &apos; NP VP .
i didn NP VP .
here we see a female cra@@ w@@ ling out IN NP under NP PP .
NP VP , but NP VP shed DT NN , NP PP .
i worked in NP PP as well , in NP PP , WRB NP VP .
it &apos;s JJ . it &apos;s NP PP VP .
SBAR , NP VP -- not ADVP NP -- RB DT VBG NP .
RB IN NP PRP RB VBP NP .
and once the soil gets S , NP VP -- NP VP , NP VP , NP VP and NP VP .
but , PRP VBZ ADJP . NP VP , and NP VP .
and this is IN NP .
and look , NP VP .
but WDT NP VP , it has VP .
all the sculp@@ tures move IN NP .
it sounds good , but i &apos;ll bet NP VP , and i &apos;ll tell you why .
and NP VP , and NP-TMP NP VP , NP-TMP NP VP , and ADVP NP ADVP VP .
free@@ ways .
what i &apos;m trying to say is the major contribu@@ tion on carbon emissions are from NP : NP : so WRB NP VP , it &apos;s ...
you should have NP PP .
and we can not VB NP .
okay , now why then is this curious rel@@ u@@ c@@ tan@@ ce and JJ NN IN NP ?
how could NN VB NP ?
and just as the j@@ ar full of water can go from NN to JJ depen@@ ding IN NP , so your brain can go from a state of VP , depen@@ ding on DT NN IN NP .
okay , the next fe@@ ature of NN , after this mar@@ vel@@ ous uni@@ fied conscious field , is that NP VP .
it &apos;s only relative to conscious ag@@ ents that NP PP VBZ NP or that NP PP VBZ NP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
but i believe ADVP VP NP , and that NP VP .
CC NP VP ; NP VP .
NP VP , and ADVP NP VP . &quot;
she doesn NP VP .
he said , IN PP . &quot; NP VP , it was NP PP IN NP , IN S . &quot;
&quot; NP VP , and NP VP ? &quot;
you know this , if NP VP , an hour feels IN NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
now what &apos;s interesting IN NP is ir@@ regular ver@@ bs between al@@ fre@@ d and jay - z have become more regular .
ADVP NP VP and NP VP .
and so i got DT NN and went and worked IN NP IN NP .
and she walked forward with NP CC NP that NP VP , put her hand on PRP and lower it .
but an@@ ger is like NN , and if NP VP and NP VP , you &apos;ve VP .
and what they &apos;ve realized is that using violence in the situations they operate in is not only less human@@ e , but it &apos;s less effective than using metho@@ ds that connect people with NP , NP re@@ build .
it &apos;s flo@@ wn IN NP .
do you mind if NP VP ?
you could say , well , NP VP .
and is art about trying to imagine what lies IN NP ?
if NP VP , you can VB S .
and thanks IN NP IN NP , i have VBN NP .
thinking it through , i realized that all those at@@ tribu@@ tes must be changed to move NN IN NP .
we re@@ ck@@ on that NP VP .
NP VP , PRP VBZ NP .
because NP VP , one person got PRP .
while PRP RB VBD NP PP , we now realize that NP VP .
and at NP , CC NP , i think S ?
today &apos;s professional theater community is defined , CONJP NP , but by NP PP -- NP PP that after NP , VP VB NP .
we want to VB NP NP .
and that &apos;s how i got IN IN NP .
at DT NN IN NP , i noticed that NP VP .
and so the next thing NP VP is NP SBAR -- NP VP ?
we have NP , NP , and WP NP VP is S .
that &apos;s PRP$ NN IN NP .
he was dra@@ g@@ ging guys out IN NP and saving DT NNS IN NP .
NP VP , RB ADVP , NP VP . &quot;
and i want my music to be IN NP . &quot;
and DT VBZ NP , and NP VP , and PP NP and PP NP .
this is in NP VP .
i said , &quot; well , that NP ADJP .
because NP VP WRB NP VP , and your music got PRP IN NP . &quot;
it &apos;s RB PRP$ JJ NN IN NP .
so it consi@@ sts IN NP .
ADVP VP , and NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
we &apos;re not doing NN IN NP RB .
this is IN NP .
DT VBZ NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
we &apos;ve also done DT JJ NN IN NP .
this is exactly what happens IN NP .
look at all the argu@@ ments NP VP .
actually , that was ari@@ st@@ ot@@ le NP VP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
what VBZ NP ?
is NP NP JJ PP ?
first , no JJ NNS fan would VB NP .
so let NP VP .
michael san@@ del : DT JJ NN IN NP
NP VP , S , ADVP S , NP VP .
and , NP VP -- NP VP .
NP VP , NP PP , and NP VP .
the therap@@ ies will be impro@@ ving faster than NP VP .
secon@@ dly , what does it mean for the public &apos;s perception of how long it &apos;s going to take IN NP VP , starting from the time NP VP ?
we can call NP NP and i cla@@ im that NP VP .
NP PP VBP ADVP VP .
audience : species on this planet have evolved with imm@@ une systems to fight off all the diseases so that NP VP .
NP VP but NP VP .
and although i want to thank NP PP there &apos;s a factor of lu@@ ck and ti@@ ming -- we are absolutely convinced that NP VP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
so we should VB NP PP .
what happens when a city deci@@ des NP VP ?
according IN NP , QP IN NP will VB NP .
and we take car cr@@ as@@ hes for VP .
but , of course , we &apos;ve seen WP NP VP .
you don NP VP .
the second reason is that NP VP .
well , we looked IN NP IN NP .
NP VP , and NP VP . DT VBZ NP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
they &apos;re JJ RB IN NP .
he thought hard . i mean , it was nearly 80 years before this that he &apos;d been IN NP .
it &apos;s very , very difficult to speak at NP PP like DT , because NP VP . everything has been said .
now , why is NP ADJP , VP ?
VBG NP S , VBG NP .
is PRP VBG VP ?
it was RB JJ . i was RB JJ .
and now let me become less sen@@ ti@@ mental , and say that saving lives -- which some of DT NN S does on this continent -- when you save the life of NP , NP , NP , NP , they are contribu@@ ting produ@@ c@@ tively into the economy .
WRB NP VP , CD IN NP today is IN S .
our in@@ ability to take charge and say to NP VP sit down . &quot;
aid can not VB NP , i &apos;m fir@@ m@@ ly convinced IN NP .
a lot has VBN VP , i don NP VP .
i &apos;m going to go IN NP and try VP .
and RB NP PP VBP NP .
you can &apos; t just sort of -- &quot; it &apos;s great NP VP got this key@@ board . &quot;
really , consciousness is se@@ ated IN NP .
NN : PP , NP VP .
so what we had NP VP was memor@@ ize DT ADJP NN NN , please .
so just TO VP , we &apos;ve VBD NP S , and like NP VP , we &apos;ll VP .
NP , NP VBZ VP .
a techni@@ cian will put the electro@@ des onto NP VP and usually after NP PP .
the first time , nothing will happen , because NP VP . &quot;
and once you &apos;ve trained up the dete@@ ctions , NP VP .
so i &apos;m going to brie@@ fly disc@@ uss NP PP .
es@@ ther du@@ fl@@ o talked DT JJ NN IN NP .
the other thing is , you know , it would be even better if you didn NP VP .
ADVP NP but NP VP .
PP , NP VP , but NP VP .
now , it turns out NP ADVP VP .
here we have NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
but i thought , no , no , experiment with NP , NP .
NP ADJP , VBZ NP .
ADJP , NP -- NP VP .
DT VBZ NP .
basically i &apos;m VP , i can &apos; NP VP .
it helped NP VP .
and NP VP , and NP VP .
these are the di@@ stances of the tu@@ bes which make NP VP .
PRP VBZ NP .
you can RB VB NP NP .
i think philosop@@ hi@@ cally , that was one of the most important pa@@ pers that we &apos;ve ever done because NP VP .
so the team developed new de@@ bu@@ g@@ ging software , where we could test each syn@@ thetic frag@@ ment to see if NP VP .
and we ad@@ ded three quot@@ ations , because PP NP VP .
or , more importantly , hiv , WRB NP VP can &apos; NP VP .
so i read RB .
this was perhaps the biggest surprise -- how flexi@@ ble NP VP , at least in minds that are not RB JJ .
i study NP , CONJP NP IN S .
and they do that by NP VP .
and it sta@@ ys that NP VP .
IN NP , NP VP , and S , CC S .
they somehow get IN NP .
well it turns out that INTJ , NP VP .
so , the ants in NP SBAR are not DT JJR IN NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
but in a small col@@ ony , it &apos;s likely VP , just because NP VP .
but it &apos;s NP PP , IN NP .
yes , it &apos;s VP .
PRP VBZ NP .
i don NP VP .
in NP SBAR ?
and so everyone can be at least happy to see NP PP IN NP .
and NP NP , VBP RB VP .
i don NP VP .
bo@@ one , PRP RB , really appreci@@ ate NP VP .
&quot; NP : NP . &quot;
NN IN NP deser@@ ted VP .
but they spent NP CC NP IN NP VP , RB IN S .
this is NP VP .
this came IN , INTJ , NP .
i mean , you didn NP VP .
CC NP VP , but ADVP NP , SBAR , PP , NP VP .
i &apos;m going to try to VB NP NP .
now , there &apos;s more good news that came along later in NP , NP .
now , we have NP PP .
and if you ask what kind of NN is condu@@ ci@@ ve IN NP VBG NP PP , it &apos;s a zero - sum situation .
it &apos;s why social organization has grown IN NP IN NP , and now here we are in a glob@@ alized world .
i think NP VP , economic engagement is generally better IN NP and so on , in this reg@@ ard .
it &apos;s un@@ fortun@@ ate that NP VP .
WDT NN IN NP had PRP VBD NP ?
PRP RB VBD NP .
in NP PP , QP NN IN NP ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ged IN S .
but he had been so afraid IN NP , until ADVP NP VP .
so , WP NP VP , NNS IN NP didn S .
so , i decided IN NP , IN IN NP .
and NP VP , ADJP ! VB PP .
PRP VBD NP .
we have shown that NP VP .
but here is NP PP . i &apos;ll just VB NP NP .
PRP VBZ VP .
NP VP , but ADVP NP VP .
PRP VBD NP PP . NN , NN .
my friends , no way NP VP .
well , to VB NP , one thing is NP VP .
NN VB NP NP-TMP ? did NN VB NP ?
DT JJ , JJ NNS , PRP VBP NP .
now , WRB NP VP , NP VP , do PRP VBP NP S ?
RB RB NP , NP , VP , DT VBZ NP .
NP VP , and ADVP NP ADVP VP .
but PRP VBP NP NP-TMP .
i go back IN NP all the time .
my mother was , sort of , very sensitive IN NP .
i went to VP , WRB NP VP .
and RB PRP VBD NP .
and there &apos;s got to be some way to do NP , NP .
and i often look at NNS as though NP VP .
che@@ f : oh , you don NP VP ? let PRP VB NP NP .
NN NN is@@ a@@ a@@ c mi@@ z@@ ra@@ hi sp@@ ins IN NP -- IN NP IN NP ! VB PP are NP PP .
and NP VP , and NP VP .
what &apos;s ADVP VP is that WHNP S , NP CC NP , VP CC VP , CC VP .
and a social movement is com@@ pris@@ ed , IN NP , S .
the second , NP VP , is JJ NN .
not ex@@ clu@@ sive IN NP , but IN NP IN NP , is pro@@ pag@@ ating DT JJ NN IN NP .
because NP VP .
it isn &apos; t when the sh@@ in@@ y new tools show up that NP VP .
the internet is the first medium in history that has NP PP IN NP .
the b@@ b@@ c got NP PP IN NP .
and RB NP VP .
DT IN NP is IN .
he had to VB NP .
ok , this is NN NN .
NP VP , but NP VP .
RB NP NP IN NP .
from RB , it &apos;s NP RB PP IN NP .
this is NP VP .
NP VP ; NP VP .
the survi@@ vor@@ s came IN NP IN NP .
after la@@ ying IN NP ADVP DT NN , he got up and found his way back IN NP .
he &apos;s VP .
NP VP , NP VP ; ADVP , NP VP .
RB NNS VBP NP .
but a demo@@ graphic divi@@ den@@ d is only as good IN NP .
and then i think NP VP .
it &apos;s RB RB IN NP .
what are those ideas ? one is , NP VP , VBP NP .
we can use NP , CC NP .
SBAR , NP ADVP VP , NP VP -- NP VP .
and this is NP PP .
so basically i want VP
and you have NP CC NP .
you have NP , NP .
in DT JJ NN WHNP S , they took a decision -- NP VP -- that NP VP .
the idea is VBN NP .
the service provi@@ ders , well , for the first time , they &apos;ve got an opportunity to provide services and grow the evidence for what they &apos;re doing IN NP and learn and demon@@ strate the value of what they &apos;re VP , not just one or two as often happens at DT NN .
it en@@ ables NN IN NP .
&quot; ha , i &apos;m the only person NP ADVP VP . &quot;
he goes , NP VP ? &quot;
why is DT ? are you too ti@@ red VP ?
PRP VBP RB VP . &quot; NP VP , NP VP .
was@@ su@@ p .
ted@@ x .
decided to use JJ NN IN NP .
we must VB NP .
it is transpar@@ ent , made RB IN NP .
they were VBG NP .
ADVP NP VP and NP VP and ADVP , NP VP -- NP VP -- and NP VP . &quot;
john is one of &#91; about NP NP very hero@@ ic , coura@@ ge@@ ous people who volunte@@ ered for DT NN .
he &apos;s NP SBAR -- how should PRP VB NP ? -- it &apos;s VBN NN IN NP .
i don NP VP , IN NP , it will not happen .
RB JJ NN VBD VP .
all NP VP , really , is NN NN , and IN S .
now , fashion designers have the broad@@ est pal@@ ette imag@@ in@@ able IN NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
PRP VBP NP .
if NP VP .
NNS NP , NP : NP .
it is bar@@ ely te@@ ther@@ ed IN NP IN NP .
NP VP , and ADVP NP VP .
and then this back down on NP CC NP can see IN S .
but i put that slide in there because i &apos;m often asked if NP VP .
and what looks like two big he@@ ap@@ s of leaves , is actually two single leaves that get sh@@ red@@ ded up by NP PP .
this bacteria was discovered several years ago by a team of NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
i think NP VP .
consider NP PP .
is he bald IN NP ? does he wear NNS ? &quot;
you could ro@@ b 200 people on NP , NP .
NP VP , SBAR , NP VP , and PP NP VP .
and IN NP , NN VBZ ADVP NP .
that &apos;s WP NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
will PRP VB VP ?
and WRB NP VP , i can VB PP , PP .
and there is NP RBR vulnerable IN NP .
i know NP VP .
who gets VP ? &quot;
and we placed PRP IN NP , NP RB .
RB , WP VBP NP VP ?
and la@@ stly , DT JJ NN IN NP WHNP S , VB NP . &quot;
NP , NP VBZ RB ADVP VP .
i don NP VP . i did not ask IN NP .
then i used , tried to VB NP .
what if one decided VP ?
VB NP ADVP , the girl will VB NP .
every ho@@ li@@ day i had IN NP was in a national park .
the pas@@ sen@@ gers who VBD PRT NP fell into NN IN NP .
i could bar@@ ely brea@@ the . i was VBG IN NP .
and after NP IN NP , he was JJ S .
and PRP VBP S , and NP VP , and NP VP .
l@@ p : NP VP : NP VP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
and RB , NP IN , EX VBD NP ; RB INTJ , PP , NP VP ; and PP , NP VP .
NP VP , PRP VBZ NP .
it &apos;s not because NP VP .
that &apos;s the one advantage WDT NP VP .
and i said , &quot; NP VP . i never cla@@ im@@ ed that . &quot;
and then she made NP VP .
and , inci@@ dent@@ ally , i call NP NP .
and i said , &quot; NP VP . &quot;
NP VP , and , PP , NP VP , but ADVP NP VP .
an amazing woman .
first of all , was that dance , even though it hadn NP VP , was her life .
the problem is , without NNS , without NP , NP like NP ADVP VP .
michael free IN NP says NP VP .
you &apos;ve got to sh@@ ine blue light on NP : NP as NP VP .
they &apos;re JJ , RB JJ .
last story here : i &apos;ve got a friend in india who told me that you haven &apos; t really te@@ sted DT NN IN NP for NP PP until NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
we are not talking about NP , CC NP , CC NP there .
UH , VBP NP . NP VP , NP VP , NP VP .
PP , NP VP , but NP VP .
i &apos;m not conne@@ cting IN NP .
so i now have this sort of NP VP .
and i thought , UH , NP VP , but NP VP .
IN NP NP PP , NP , CC NP .
not the pain@@ ter , i don NP VP .
PRP VBD S , and ADVP NP VP , and NP VP ?
but it is difficult VP .
RB VBD NP .
so when i read in a newspaper in the business page the story of n@@ ollywood , i really felt this is an incredible opportunity to tell a story that goes against NP VP .
we &apos;re not doing NP CC NP .
it &apos;s all IN NP .
VB NP .
the nigeri@@ an film@@ makers really , really , are doing WP NP VP .
difficult , e@@ h ? it &apos;s JJ .
and we know that NP VP .
NP VP , NNP VBZ NP . NN NN CC NN IN NP IN NP .
we were talking IN NP ? it &apos;s VBG .
you know , we have to go IN NP .
NP VP and ADVP NP VP .
so we have port@@ al because NP VP .
RB NN , NN , NNS , and NP , NP .
so in a way , we &apos;re showing NP PP and that is NN IN NP but that NP VP .
i was concerned about making a place for NP PP .
i did DT NN IN NP .
we made the dra@@ wings of NP CC NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
and it seemed to work IN NP VP .
and her@@ man mil@@ ler has this philosoph@@ y of having DT NN -- NP VP .
and so then he put two bri@@ d@@ ges -- this NP VP &apos; period .
they &apos;ve been building it so long NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
this is a piece of NN IN NP .
and then you enter IN NP and RB RB IN .
and NP VP and NP VP .
if NP VP , please contact PRP .
and i tried to -- NP VP .
NP PP VBD NP NP .
and this is a tea@@ po@@ t NP VP .
PRP VBD NP .
and so this is WP NP VP .
ADVP NP VP , and ADVP NP VP .
so we wanted to try to find a way to make a stron@@ ger bri@@ qu@@ ette so that NP VP .
but this is NP PP .
and we need to think about WRB NP VP .
and this bone is pe@@ p@@ per@@ ed , as NP VP , with NP VP .
as NP VP , it &apos;s VP .
that &apos;s exactly what people used VP .
PRP VBD NP .
because NP VP , DT NN IN NP might VB VP . &quot;
and beauty doesn NP VP equ@@ ate IN NP .
&quot; i want VP . this is WRB NP VP . &quot;
ADVP NP VP -- and NP VP .
how do we RB change NP NP ?
se@@ vent@@ y percent of NP VP is consum@@ ed IN NP .
it is about WP NP VP .
why can we have NP CC NP ?
we really need to change DT JJ NN IN NP .
they do NP PP .
one of the things NP VP is public - private partner@@ ships .
and , NP VP , i &apos;m not IN ADJP PP .
so we &apos;re spending NP , ADJP , IN NP .
and NP VP , and NP VP ?
when i go to NP VP and NP VP and NP VP , &quot; consciousness , &quot; their eyes don &apos; t gla@@ ze over -- their li@@ ps cur@@ l into a s@@ nar@@ l .
that &apos;s DT NN IN NP here .
this means that NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
and i started across the hall in north car@@ ol@@ ina , because i thought NP VP , and would have NP SBAR IN NP .
how many of you did it by ro@@ tat@@ ing the one on the left IN NP eye , to see if NP VP ?
if NP VP , there &apos;s NP PP .
and keep going , IN NP , saying , &quot; NP VP . &quot;
NNS RB RB IN NP .
they &apos;re basically attemp@@ ts at fig@@ uring out WP NP VP .
because you still have NP PP .
NP PP VBP NP .
jon@@ as eli@@ as@@ son : how to VB NP
what do we know about NP CC NP WDT NP VP ?
you , yourself , will find yourself in DT NN NN -- or PRP$ NN , your child -- there are NP VP , people who VBP , &quot; yes , i know RB WP NP VP . &quot;
well he also saw that SBAR , NP VP .
NP VP , WHADVP PP ?
WRB VBZ NP VP ?
it &apos;s RB JJ .
don JJ NN NN IN NP .
there &apos;s a guy on NN that i know , NP NP , and he wrote the e-@@ patient ra@@ p .
and she saw that if NP VP then the scan is DT JJ NN .
da@@ ve de@@ bron@@ k@@ art : VB NP
and this , in NP CC NP , equ@@ ates to NP : NP .
but one other extremely unique thing about bat@@ s is that NP VP . they use ech@@ olo@@ cation .
this is VBN NP .
just have a quick look . and what we need VP is that NP IN NP , PRP VBP ADJP .
in europe alone , by 20@@ 50 , there is going to be NP PP , and NP PP .
em@@ ma te@@ el@@ ing : DT NN IN NP
europe had to be dra@@ g@@ ged IN NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
NP VP ; NP VP .
it turns out that NP VP .
they worked out NP VP .
NNP NNP : NP NP
all right , you &apos;ve NP VP . &quot;
so i was inspired IN NP .
so i &apos;m passionate about VBG NP NP .
and we currently have NN IN NP .
we need it for our everyday life , in order to VB NP NP .
i continu@@ ed studying craft tradi@@ tions and collabor@@ ating IN NP , next IN NP .
my life was not going to VB NP .
my arti@@ stic hori@@ z@@ ons continue VP .
it was NP PP .
you could be attac@@ ked IN NP .
they &apos;re learning IN NP .
values are NP PP .
RB NP PP -- SBAR , NP VP .
well , consider by NP , NP .
the fact that NP VP here does not change IN FRAG .
this is why we spend our time talking about NP PP or NP CC NP .
whenever we are talking IN NP certain opini@@ ons must be ex@@ clu@@ ded .
sam har@@ r@@ is : S , CC S , and NP VP ?
sam har@@ r@@ is : science can VB NP
here is DT NN , NP , NP , because NP VP .
only the eg@@ g of the par@@ asi@@ te will be in@@ ser@@ ted IN NP .
everything is just fine IN NP .
CC NP VP : ADVP NP ?
NP IN NP , PRP VBZ ADJP .
automo@@ tive retro@@ fu@@ tur@@ ism is NP PP .
this is NP PP .
NP VP for VP .
it was perfectly clear . i didn NP VP .
DT JJ NN IN NP is NP PP . and if NP VP , that may VB S . in NP PP , they VBD NP and SBAR .
so , DT NNS , IN NP , are ADJP PP . and NP ADVP , DT NN . i &apos;m ADVP VP , IN NP , IN NP . WP NP VP , how IN NP did DT NNS not VB SBAR ?
instead , all the major thre@@ ats facing PRP NN are NNS ADVP IN NP . and since PRP VBD NP , we can also solve DT NNS . that then means that NP VP .
well we know that NP VP .
WP VBP NP VP ?
how are we going VP ?
this has happened IN NP IN NP .
NP PP VBZ NP .
so why are PRP not VBG NP ADVP ?
look IN NP RB . look IN NP RB .
that means NP VP .
in fact , when we &apos;re VP , it &apos;s how PRP VBP NP .
i dra@@ ped them cas@@ ually over NP PP .
it was NP SBAR .
DT VBZ NP . RB JJ , NN NP NP ?
so , it &apos;s IN NP . you can VB S .
it can be used for calcul@@ ating NP PP .
but WP NP VP , i VBP , VBZ NP : NP , NP PP .
you &apos;re using NP , NP , PP .
let NP VP .
and they already had NP VP .
instead of using NP , NP , we &apos;re using VBN NN .
for those who probably know , if you don NP VP and NP VP , you know what happens .
WP NP VP , this is NP NP .
and NP VP , and NP VP .
there VP NP , NP VP , was PRP ?
it &apos;s NP PP .
the biggest emplo@@ yer is the NN NN process@@ ing plant .
ADVP , NP VP : NP VP -- PP , SBAR , NP VP .
it &apos;s the physical construction of NP CC NP .
ADVP NP VP and NP VP .
and during that time , they &apos;re doing everything from VP and actually testing them , building them , prototyp@@ ing them , fig@@ uring out if NP VP and re@@ fin@@ ing that .
but we feel like NP VP .
generally , what PRP VBP PP is not deser@@ ti@@ fying , and WP NP VP is , and these are IN NP .
RB , NP VP , and NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
but we bi@@ ologists and e@@ col@@ o@@ gi@@ sts had never tac@@ kl@@ ed NN IN ADJP IN NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
VBP SBAR . VBP NP . VBP NP , NP .
and NP VP . NP VP ; PP , NP VP .
IN NP , DT NML JJ NN .
IN S , SBAR , NP VP ; NP VP .
NN : CC NP VP .
WRB VBZ NP VP ? NP VP , and S , NP ADVP VP .
NN NP : FRAG . NNP NP .
NP VP -- NP VP . &quot;
and PRP VBD , IN NP , no , RB . you can .
it &apos;s RB NP WHNP S ?
NP VP NP VP WHNP SQ . &quot;
if NP VP -- but NP VP , what was the point ?
i &apos;m UH , VB VP ! don JJ NN NN IN NP , you know .
NP VP , PRP VBD ADVP . NP VP -- NP VP .
and NP VP and NP VP and NP VP ! &quot;
now this is obviously a powerful , NP VP , insi@@ ght .
NP VP , but NP VP .
UH , IN NP NP VP .
once you &apos;ve done that , RB RB VBZ NP .
i esti@@ ma@@ ted that , NP , PP , NP VP .
so my usual question is , what do you mean IN NP ? &quot;
i don NP VP .
but there &apos;s a fantastic way to do DT IN NP .
and of course , it turns IN NP .
and you know SBAR , NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
these out@@ si@@ ghts ran@@ ged IN NP IN NP , IN NP IN NP .
but it &apos;s all good IN NP .
NN VBZ ADJP .
and i see my life as NP PP .
as i say in my book , i &apos;m je@@ wish in the same way NP VP .
RB , RB DT NN VBD ADVP .
so , i was able to VB NP .
but this one is -- the bi@@ ble says that you can not touch women during NP , CC NP , you can not sit on a seat where a men@@ stru@@ ating woman has sat .
NP VP , NP ADVP , NP VP .
and they said , &quot; we don NP VP , but NP VP . &quot;
so , anyway , thank you so much for le@@ tting NP VP .
the problem , as NP VP , has TO VP . &quot;
but if you dis@@ played that on NP CC NP , it would be meaning@@ less TO VP .
ADVP NP VP , PRP VBP NP .
there &apos;re NP PP .
RB JJ work , whether NP VP , is always important .
MD NP VP , or VBZ NP PP ?
john under@@ ko@@ ff@@ ler : poin@@ ting IN NP
WP NP VP would not VB VP .
someone who has done something like NP VP , has put something forward in public .
but the group of NP VP , they said , &quot; NP VP .
NP VP : NP VP .
and may it run forever , because NP VP .
or you could play many games in NP PP , even if NP VP .
england invented NP NP , and said , VB S cri@@ cket . &quot;
CD NNS , NN CC NN .
but WP NP VP was VBG NP ADVP .
we started getting NN CC NN IN NP .
sh@@ an@@ e war@@ ne sold IN NP .
MD NP VP , NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
now , you see a very interesting pattern here , which is first of NP , NP , ADVP NP .
and most people VBP , VBP ADJP , NP VP . &quot;
WRB NP VP they &apos;re NP VP . why ?
IN NP , PRP VBD NP .
for DT IN NP , sitting IN NP is NP PP , and IN NP is NP PP .
if PRP VBP NP , PP , you &apos;ve probably travel@@ ed IN NP .
that is , NP VP .
NP ADVP VP : S , CC S : NP VP .
RB NP PP IN S , but IN NP DT VBP NP .
but is there a rational fear that actually , the reason NP VP is because NP VP ?
so , PRP VBP , when NP VP and NP VP , our general tenden@@ cy is TO VP .
ad@@ g : in VBG NP .
he appar@@ ently lost DT NN IN NP .
RB , PRP VBD VP .
DT NN VBZ NP ADVP . &quot;
that can VB NP .
the phr@@ ase &apos; art is whatever &apos; expres@@ ses the current inclu@@ si@@ ven@@ ess that surro@@ unds NP : NP .
so by and large , they are good IN NP .
NP VP , NP : NP : VBP VP ...
when we actually looked IN NP NP , FRAG , we were able TO VP . what we found was that IN NP , NN VBD NP .
it makes less sense that NP VP .
NN PRP MD .
mar@@ c@@ us : and how many soldiers have you rec@@ ru@@ ited to fight DT NN IN NP ?
new@@ ton a@@ du@@ ak@@ a : thank you . the first clip , really , is totally trying to capture WP NP VP , and WRB NP VP .
PRP MD VP -- ?
NNP : FW !
we don &apos; t need no more trouble no more trouble we don &apos; t need NP NP . wake up ! everybody wake up . road block !
WRB ? because NP VP .
NN VBP NP .
or NP VP , and NP VP .
all right . NN , NNS RB RB .
NP VP ; NP VP .
RB WRB VBP NP VP ?
NP VP , and NP VP .
PRP VBD S , and NP VP and NP VP ...
f@@ g : i don NP VP .
i was RB JJ .
and i think that NP , VP .
it was a table as long as NP VP , and NP VP , and my guys .
JJ NN : NP VP ?
totally trans@@ formed IN NP .
NP SBAR -- NP ADVP VP . PRP VBD NP .
and IN NP NN -- NP VP , and NP ADVP VP .
this is wus@@ han , one of NP SBAR .
what NP VP VBZ : NP is changing IN S . this is a hol@@ d@@ out .
and i &apos;m sure there are people here who probably know better than NP VP , but NP VP .
they were just wo@@ und up doing NP NP long , until NP VP , with a stern voice , say , &quot; okay , everybody free@@ ze . &quot;
this was one of the biggest fac@@ tor@@ ies NP VP .
and as much as there are NP PP PRN IN NP , i &apos;m really hop@@ ing that NP VP and will start to VB NP .
and anything that you can do to VB NP would be fantastic .
and NP NP VP -- SBAR PRN NP ADVP VP . &quot;
and the reason NP VP &apos;s NP PP .
plasti@@ cs have NP PP .
and PRP RB VBD NP .
NP VP , PRP VBP NP .
and finally , i hope NP VP . &quot;
you know , we &apos;re the smar@@ test thing out there , why can &apos; t NP VP ?
NP VP , so NP VP .
but this is NP PP .
well , you might actually imagine NP VP .
the more surprising thing was that SBAR VP , but quanti@@ ta@@ tively IN WHNP NP VP .
your other option is a bit safe . your just going to VB NP money for sure .
so what &apos;s VP ?
NP PP VBZ NP .
RB , NP : NP VP , or NP VP .
well , one thing NP VP is that NP VP .
VBP NP .
and i feel that way because NP PP , IN NP , MD VP .
DT VBZ NP .
the engineering is , tru@@ th@@ fully , DT JJ NN IN NP .
NML NNS VBD NP .
think IN NP : what other business do you know NP CC NP IN NP , IN S ?
no one is better at NP PP .
let NP VP , that open government is not about transpar@@ ent government .
we don NP VP .
in fact , she indi@@ cated that if NP VP , RB RB MD NP VP , CC NP VP , NP NP MD VP , and WHADVP S , EX VBZ NP . &quot;
and , like NP VP sp@@ in NP PP .
and he said , &quot; NP VP .
and , according to jes@@ us , the word comes forth , &quot; you must love NP , NP VP , and your neighb@@ or as yourself . &quot;
i close with DT NN -- NP VP -- because NP VP .
the viet@@ na@@ m prote@@ sts , the com@@ memor@@ ation of all that died in the pan@@ de@@ mic of NNS , the mar@@ ch for NP NP , right up until NP .
one re@@ de@@ em@@ ing fe@@ ature is NP VP and it &apos;s VP , and it &apos;s VBD NP .
and it has VP .
that &apos;s the pan@@ the@@ on next IN NP .
DT VBZ NP .
so i have brand@@ ed PRP IN NP .
WHNP S NP , NP .
sometimes you got VP .
don &apos; t even know the day NP VP .
and one thing that sho@@ cked NP VP they brought an arab musi@@ cian to come and enter@@ tain the soldiers .
but DT VBD NP .
ADVP , NP VP , so NP VP .
he never knew his father very well , because NP VP .
NP VP ; NP VP .
all that i want to tell you is that the reason that this has happened is because death pen@@ al@@ ty law@@ yers have understood that the earlier you interven@@ e in NP , NP that NP VP .
what we &apos;re talking IN NP is just as complicated .
now , it was RB JJ .
i hope RB NP NP SBAR , there are going VP .
i mean , s@@ ant@@ a NP VP , right ? &quot;
NNP CD VBZ RB NP . PRP VBZ NP-TMP . NN CC PRP VBD , S ? &quot;
ADVP , NP VP and , NP VP , S , CC S , RB RB , ADJP , so NP VP . NN CC PRP VBD ADJP , SBAR .
i said , &quot; what happened IN NP ? &quot;
what if NP VP and NP VP ?
we have focused IN NP .
NP VP , SBAR , NP VP .
when it has a sc@@ ar@@ ce resource that NP VP , it thinks in terms of efficiency .
NP PP VBZ NP VP .
that &apos;s one way of looking IN NP .
and that means NP VP .
do you invest NP , CC NP ?
they don NP VP .
what turned out to deter@@ mine whether someone would stop and help a stran@@ ger in need was how much of a hur@@ ry they thought NP VP -- were they feeling they were late , or were they absor@@ bed in what they were going to talk about .
now this is a -- NP VP .
right now , as NP VP , DT NNS WHNP S have VBN NP .
NP-TMP NP VP , QP JJ NNS RB VBD NP .
i realized then that NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
an@@ anda sh@@ ank@@ ar ja@@ y@@ ant : NN NN IN NP
but PP NP VP -- NP VP .
what do you mean , &quot; NP VP ? what &apos;s NP : NP ?
NNS VBZ NP .
let NP VP .
NN : JJ .
now if i go RP IN NP , you &apos;ll think that NP VP .
NP VP but NP VP .
all together , they achie@@ ved DT NNS : increas@@ ed NP PP on NP , NP .
now here , we see DT NN IN NP show NP , NP , NP , NP RB IN NP S .
it &apos;s getting IN NP .
VBP NP , VBP NP .
and he said , &quot; oh , i teach IN NP .
so i just thought , &quot; NP VP , or NP NP VP . &quot;
if we ask einstein , he would say , &quot; whether NP VP , or NP VP , depen@@ ds on PRP$ NN IN NP . &quot;
RB , JJ RB RB . &quot;
and this was colle@@ cted IN NP .
DT VBD NP NP .
you can VB NP .
NP VP , so NP VP . and NP , NP VBD NP .
so it &apos;s very clear that if NP VP .
DT NN VP , ADVP VP .
NP PP and NP PP .
PP , NP VP , ADVP , NP VP .
but if NP VP , we can VB PP equ@@ als NN IN NP , WDT VP .
NP VP -- NP VP .
NP VP , PRP VBZ NP S .
and DT JJ NN VBZ ADJP .
RB , PP , NP VP , and NP VP .
MD NP VP , NP VP , NP VP . &quot;
RB RB , RB PRP MD VP . &quot;
and sometimes that can be different amo@@ unts IN NP or IN NP or IN NP .
&quot; WP NP VP ? &quot; sha@@ k@@ espe@@ are said .
JJ NN IN NP .
i was just st@@ ag@@ ger@@ ed IN NP .
and i think that NP VP .
in short , they are ac@@ qu@@ ir@@ ing the status that NP VP .
it &apos;s one of many , many characteri@@ stics that women have that NP VP .
we &apos;re also re@@ turning IN NP .
this is why you can feel NP PP IN NP IN S .
dop@@ am@@ ine is associated IN NP .
but i want to VB NP NP .
and everybody there agre@@ ed NP VP and NP VP .
i actually just as@@ sm@@ ed NP VP .
in NN , what if NP VP , the ti@@ p of DT JJ NN ?
ADVP NP VP , but NP VP .
but NP PP VBP VP .
peter at@@ ti@@ a : is DT NN NN VBG NP ?
so when i was born , i guess you could say NP VP .
i mean , i think most people in DT NN understand that NP VP .
ADVP , NP VP , and NP VP .
ADVP NP VP , and NP PRN VP .
we need NP PP VP .
char@@ lie le@@ d@@ better , yesterday , i thought , talked very artic@@ ul@@ ately about this need to VB NP , to bring NNS IN NP .
so they sna@@ pped IN NP .
george de me@@ stra@@ l -- this is not bu@@ gs all IN NP -- was walking his dog in DT NN and got covered IN NP , RB RB little pri@@ ck@@ ly things , and from that came vel@@ cr@@ o .
it &apos;s been all IN NP .
i talk IN NP PDT DT NN .
so , again , we were asked to design a water pu@@ mp for NP VP .
con@@ ta@@ gi@@ ous VBZ NP .
and IN NP , IN S , PRP VBD VP .
they are VBG . they are VBG NP .
NP , RRC -- VP .
so , today who is it going to take to spread NP PP IN NP ?
and interest@@ ingly , as NP VP , they were DT JJ JJ NNS .
RB , PRP VBZ RB NP .
if NP VP , and S , CC S how do you measure NP PP ?
round IN NP , i did NP , SBAR .
so IN NP , we would VB NP PP .
so really , re@@ transl@@ ating that NP and developing NN WHNP S , it was virtu@@ ally pollution - free .
so there has been NP SBAR , NP SBAR , and will feed IN NP IN NP .
NP VP , NP VP , NP VP .
and here you can see how they really cra@@ f@@ ted DT JJ NN NN IN NP , IN NP .
PP NP VP , and NP VP .
so light is , IN NP , IN NP ADVP -- VP .
and we can actually leave it out WRB NP VP and WRB NP VP .
can we be more gent@@ le with NN ?
IN NP , PRP VBZ NP .
is it WDT NP VP ?
DT NN NNS IN NP IN NP .
if this woman has to carry water on her head for NP CC NP , you can not be cele@@ br@@ ating that .
NP VP , NP VP , NP VP ; but NP VP .
ADVP NP VP ; NP VP .
NP VP , NP VP , NP VP . NP , NP , CC NP MD VP .
JJR NP , NP VBZ NP .
my technology .
we were talking IN NP .
she said , NP VP . &quot;
then you don NP VP .
PP , NP VP ; NP VP .
or s@@ no@@ w@@ mobil@@ es . you don NP VP .
and NP VP , and NP VP . &quot;
so , having seen this , and having worried IN NP IN NP , the first thing PRP VBP is VB PRT NP and VB NP , VB NP , VB NP ADVP .
we &apos;ve been working on this , actually , as an alternative energy source , starting way back with john@@ son & amp ; john@@ son , to run an i@@ bot , because the best bat@@ ter@@ ies you could get -- 10 watt - hours per NP , NP , NP , NP , NP in NP PP -- which VBZ SBAR .
NP NP VBZ NP PP . PRP VBZ SBAR . &quot;
however , while it &apos;s easier to think of NP , NP , NP , NP , PP , and NP , NP , NP , PP , if you think about it , the lat@@ ter are only provi@@ ding a service to the former .
but this is NP PP .
NP VP , but NP , NP VP .
and so to me the question is not whether these dynam@@ ics will continue the way NP VP .
and then it &apos;s NN VP . last year .
the next phase NP VP was dis@@ plac@@ ement .
here &apos;s NP SBAR .
NP VP ; NP VP ; NP VP -- NP VP , but NP VP .
and what &apos;s interesting is that it was just 199@@ 0 when it was NP NP .
they use NP PP .
i want to share one story about NP VP .
and so we met NP PP .
but again i would say that NP VP .
and for DT JJ NN ADVP IN NP , his children would go IN NP .
VBP NP .
you have my friend , who has DT NN IN NP -- IN NP .
PRP VBP NP , and NP VP , and NP VP . &quot;
NP VP , and NP VP .
and PRP VBP NP .
NP VP , and NP NP VP .
i put the bad pictures up too , because NP VP .
they &apos;re the largest of NP , NP -- bon@@ y fish .
the european population and north african -- the eastern blu@@ ef@@ in tun@@ a -- is fis@@ hed at NP : NP almost every year .
we basically are taking the same satelli@@ te phone parts , or the same parts that are in NP , NP .
RB , NP PP VBP VP .
NP VP , NP VP , and ADVP , NP VP .
these become for@@ th@@ right in places NP VP .
the tun@@ a team from NN has done NP : NP .
we did this with NP : NP .
UH RB . PRP VBP NP . PRP VBP NP .
and NP VP NP ADVP VP , PP ? &quot;
and i was like , &quot; NP VP , and ADVP NP VP . &quot;
this was on NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
and on sun@@ day , jun@@ e 14@@ th at 2009 -- this was actually about two o &apos; clock in the after@@ noon in NP , NP -- this was my a@@ partment there .
because NP VP .
he : well it goes IN NP .
and NP , NP .
RB , PP , NP VP , and INTJ ADVP , NP VP .
how do we mi@@ mic NP VP ?
it was ridi@@ cul@@ ous . i couldn &apos; t get DT JJ NN NN IN NP IN NP .
ADVP NP VP , but NP , VP .
ADVP NP VP -- NP PP . NN NN VBZ NP . &quot;
now i &apos;m going to show you what that does IN NP .
it &apos;s simply the propor@@ tion of the population who agree NP VP .
but it goes IN NP .
the position of women , how clo@@ sely they keep IN NP , are on opposite ends of NP PP .
but i should VB NP PP .
and of course , others using NP VP .
NP VP , and SBAR , NP VP .
how do you en@@ sure NP VP and NP VP ?
notice NN IN NP ?
DT NN NN VBZ NP .
NP VP VBD S NP PP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
second IN NP , NP VP , it feels RB .
now , the weird thing is google lies , because if NP VP , &quot; NP VP , &quot; you don S . &apos; we do it anyway . &quot;
ADVP NP VP -- NP , NP .
no big deal .
and behavi@@ oral design is all about feeling IN NP .
PRP VBZ ADJP . WP DT JJ NN .
and that &apos;s what &apos;s JJ NP .
but it was quite obvious , quite clear , that for this particular NN WHNP S , the re@@ mot@@ er NP VP , the worse NP VP .
anyway , so i &apos;m pro@@ pos@@ ing that NP VP .
so he figured that out . it took him over two minutes to figure out that NP VP .
S , ADVP S , so NP VP . &quot;
what could they learn VP ?
NP , NP ADVP NP VP . &quot;
VBP NP .
and NP , NP-TMP , NP VP -- and NP VP -- PRP VBD , S . &quot;
and anyway , my tour -- it was kind IN NP .
secon@@ dly , the government had ignor@@ ed all available alterna@@ tives to war , which IN NP VBD NP ADVP .
my pen@@ sion was IN NP .
why don &apos; t NP VP ? &quot;
and NP VP , and NP VP ? WP SBAR ! IN NP , WHADVP S .
what this means is NP VP , and that NP VP .
and of course , everybody got it . everybody went , NP INTJ , ADVP , NP VP .
it &apos;s NP PP .
ADVP SBAR VP , and NP VP .
RB RBS NN VBZ NP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
as NP VP , you see IN S .
look IN NP IN NP .
JJ CC JJ .
NP VP , ADJP ?
and then she cl@@ ari@@ fied . she said , &quot; NP VP . it means that NP VP .
because , NP VP , dna is IN NP .
PRP VBZ NP . PRP VBP RB VP .
CC NP , NN NN VBZ VP . &quot;
there NNS ADJP NN left VP , and if NP VP i ur@@ ge NP VP .
but sometimes it &apos;s as though NP VP and NP VP .
but here &apos;s NP : NP .
dur@@ k@@ heim called this level the level of the sac@@ red because he believed that NP VP .
he said , &quot; if DT CD NN VBD NP , this tri@@ be would VB NP and VB NP . &quot;
and as NP VP , they grow , and WHADVP S , PRP VBP S , and NP VP and NP VP .
it happened again about 120 or a 1@@ 40 million years ago when some soli@@ t@@ ary was@@ ps began creating NP , NP , CC NP .
i don NP VP .
and that gives NP VP .
so i realized then that NP VP .
here is another RB JJ scene . this is NP NP .
and the thing you really hope for VP they burn up , which we won NP VP . so .
and this gra@@ ff@@ iti artist has come RB , made NP NP better , and then moved on .
and the more you try to think about it , the further NP VP , and NP , NP VP .
that was it . that &apos;s all NP VP . and not too far off .
and it was pur@@ pos@@ ely done VP .
NP VP ; NP VP .
the co@@ v@@ et@@ ed right - hand page was not given RP IN NP .
what &apos;s next ? what &apos;s next is going to VB NP .
and if NP VP , you &apos;ve S .
something , again , that went back IN NP RBR JJ .
this is NP PP . NP VP , and NP VP , has not RB VBN PP NN NN IN NP .
PRP RB VB NP . EX VBZ NP .
and he has decided to treat them as if NP VP and to do DT JJ NN , and try VP .
so we &apos;ve NP VP .
and so a ham@@ mer , when PRP VBP NP , that &apos;s WP NP VP .
and if NP VP that game exten@@ ds and continu@@ es RB WHADVP S .
and while NP PP , i worked IN NP .
it &apos;s VBN NP .
ADVP NP VP , and NP VP .
and over DT NNS IN NP is QP NNS IN NP , for@@ cing water down IN NP toward NP PP , until NP VP .
and NP PP .
and a small group of JJ NNS changed that NP .
now , syl@@ via &apos;s ted NP VP .
now the rules that PRP VBD S are constantly being monit@@ or@@ ed IN NP .
and then i thought -- in my 4@@ 0s i started thinking , &quot; well , why don &apos; t NP VP ?
RB GW NP .
NP VP , and ADVP NP VP .
so let &apos;s first talk IN NP .
so is london a sc@@ aled up bir@@ m@@ ing@@ ham , which is NP , NP . , etc . ?
and we &apos;ve looked IN NP .
that would be bad IN NP .
but you notice , NP VP , because NP VP .
right IN NP that NP VP , i take RP IN NP and move IN NP .
but what was interesting about this position NP VP , was i had this really in a truly public school , and we got to have NP SBAR .
DT VBZ NP .
and when we do NP PP this year , they will do RBR this time , because NP VP , because NP VP .
it &apos;s simply acceler@@ ating NP SBAR .
4@@ 1 people who were basically outside of VP , paying for the one reti@@ re@@ e who was VBG NP .
if NP VP , why can VB NP S ?
therefore , if NP VP , they may VB NP .
and that material in@@ duced the body to switch back on DT NN NN that NP VP have before .
PRP VBZ NP .
it &apos;s NP PP .
PRP VBZ NP .
VBP NP .
UH , JJ .
and : INTJ , NP VP .
it &apos;s JJ . it &apos;s JJ .
but RB on NP PP , NP VP , sar@@ ah S .
so , we deser@@ ve just as much to be NN IN NP as everybody else .
my name VBZ NP and VBP NP ADVP PP .
my son , he says NP VP .
so i think maybe ted , you impact people &apos;s lives in the ways maybe even NP VP .
that &apos;s NP , NP . thank PRP ADVP PP .
but i &apos;m actually here today to VB NP .
i started NP VP .
but there &apos;s also a lot of people that you don NP VP .
and we don NP ADVP VP .
we &apos;ve sent CD NNS IN NP IN NP .
and finally , an e@@ bay li@@ sting IN NP NP , NP . please contact NNP VB .
VP , NP PP VBP VP .
it &apos;s been ta@@ ped IN NP .
NN WHNP S , NN WHNP S , or it works and you can &apos; NN NN NP . and there &apos;s nothing wrong IN NP , so long as NP VP and NP VP .
that &apos;s WP NP VP .
these are NP , CC NP .
NP VP and NP VP , and PRP VBP SBAR .
NP VP -- NP VP .
NP VP , PRP VBD VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
but over@@ thro@@ wing NP VP and building a stable democracy is a bit more complicated .
you have a situation where DT NN IN NP is VBG NP .
and here in the united king@@ dom there &apos;s also conc@@ ern over a law called the digital economy act that NP VP .
but in the last two decades , it has experienced an un@@ pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ented expan@@ sion , now accoun@@ ting for NP VP .
the NP JJ t func@@ tion@@ ing RB .
NP VP , and NP VP .
so i have VBN NP NP S .
now , i was taken IN NP IN NP VP .
ho@@ o@@ ked NP up to my laptop , and within RB CD minutes he had pen@@ e@@ tr@@ ated NP PP .
there is no roman@@ ce involved with NP PP .
NN VBD NP .
you &apos;ve believed PRP IN NP .
all his colleagues said , &quot; NP VP .
the only ex@@ ception is the na@@ ked som@@ ali@@ an mole - rat , which never puts its nose above NP PP .
try to imagine a gor@@ ill@@ a VBG NP , CC NP VP , compared IN NP , we are hal@@ f@@ way to being sha@@ ped like DT NN .
NN NN NN , PRP VBZ VP .
NN VBZ INTJ .
CD -- NP VP .
UH , NP : NP .
S , CC S , and , NP VP , NP VP -- NP VP .
and NN NN .
NP VP , and NP VP .
i think that NP VP , it &apos;s up . &quot;
you can VB NP NP .
NP VP , S , but ADVP NP VP .
so when PRP VBP NP , here &apos;s WP NP VP : you &apos;re going VP .
and ADVP NP VP , and NP VP .
and i thought , ADVP RB , INTJ .
DT ADJP NN IN NP helped NP VP .
yet we di@@ ther , VBG NP S , even though ADVP NP VP . &quot;
our problem and our trage@@ dy is that in NP , NP , &quot; means IN S ? what ?
it causes NP VP .
so , WRB NP VP , you know , NP , CC NP , NP , NP , NP .
but DT NN IN NP RB that NP VP .
RB RB VBZ DT NN .
when americans go IN NP and mar@@ ry DT JJ , they have very low di@@ vor@@ ce rates .
and most surpris@@ ingly to me , they sometimes can even see NN IN NP .
and this is the con@@ version of one group of NP CC NP .
so what we &apos;re trying to do is , we &apos;re trying to push these technologies towards creating bottom - up construction approach@@ es for architecture , which NP NP WHNP S .
RB , DT VBZ NP .
NN VBZ VP . S , NP VP and , INTJ , VP . PRP VBZ NP .
i &apos;m JJ . tell NP VP . NNP NNP IN NP , i was IN NP .
this person is likely to have NP PP .
this ep@@ iso@@ de led IN NP IN NP .
they wouldn &apos; t experience re@@ stra@@ in@@ ts as NP VP . &quot;
&apos; okay . small . fire on NN . tell NP RB VP .
so let NP VP .
WRB NP VP , i lost PRP$ JJS NN IN NP .
second it &apos;s VBG NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
and NP VP you all know , S .
but they have no in@@ cen@@ tive VP .
with NP VP , ro@@ b har@@ mon has VBN NP S . farmers and be@@ er companies find NP VP . CC NN ; NP CC NP ; / PRP & NN ;
but , UH .
he &apos;s by NP VP .
and maybe because IN NP , compassion is NP JJ .
RB WP VBP NP ?
RB DT JJ NN VBZ NP .
attention is NP PP .
NN HYPH NN tan : JJ NN IN NP
and it took a lot of coura@@ ge for these defen@@ ders to decide that NP VP .
and IN NP , PRP RB VBD NP .
and i was sitting NN IN NP , and said , &quot; WRB MD NP VP ? how can we make sure that NP VP ?
so i thank you for having the prop@@ he@@ tic imagination to imagine DT NN IN NP together , and invi@@ te you into NP PP .
you know WRB NP VP ?
it can be a school of NN IN NP .
hell@@ a jon@@ geri@@ us is NP SBAR .
so , designers sometimes don NP VP , but they &apos;re func@@ tional IN NP .
and DT VBZ NP .
but i &apos;m going to try and do something different , and try and just close the loo@@ p with NP PP , and try and put a face to NP PP .
and NP VP , SBAR , FRAG , S .
my father , WP NP VP , died of NP PP .
how would you look IN NP ?
so we need to start VBG NP .
and i can &apos; NP VP .
NP VP , PRP VBP RB VP .
NP VP , SINV , so NP VP ?
and DT VBZ ADVP NP .
long distance running was not only good IN NP - being but it helped NP VP .
but for every disaster NP VP , the mar@@ ath@@ on found ways to VB NP ADVP .
i believe NP VP .
he was RB RB IN NP deli@@ vering DT NN .
she is really DT NN IN NP .
i &apos;m just going to sell these to NP PP .
in may IN NP , at NP JJ , IN NP and NP PP , i was diagno@@ sed IN NP IN NP .
RB DT VBP NP .
most of NP SBAR either lived IN NP or were NP SBAR .
this is probably the sky@@ line that JJS IN NP know IN NP .
NN VBZ NP ADVP . PRP VBD NP .
these risks directly affect the sustain@@ ability of NP CC NP .
imagine a country with NP : NP : but VBG NP NP . infrastructure engineer fa@@ had al - attiya talks about DT JJ NNS WHNP S .
NP VP , and PP NP VP .
you see NP VP .
so there are so many things NP VP .
it is true that NP VP .
2011 was a NP PP - powered resi@@ stance , starting IN NP and spre@@ ading IN NP . how did this resi@@ stance work so well ? s@@ r@@ d@@ ja po@@ po@@ vi@@ c la@@ ys out the plans , skills and tools NP VP . & lt ; em & gt ; & lt ; / em & gt ;
S , NP VBP NP VP ? &quot;
DT NN IN NP .
PRP VBP NP .
and the purpose is not VP .
this is IN NP .
PRP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
NP VP -- SBAR NP VP -- NP VP .
it is a dream of man@@ kind to fly IN NP .
we have VP .
and the ir@@ ony is that NP VP .
NN NN : S , NP VP .
NP PP VBZ VP .
the re@@ ven@@ u@@ es increase at a higher level , giving us a healthy mar@@ g@@ in while NP VP .
now , how do you make NP VP ?
NP VP , and NP VP .
IN NP , NP VP , NP VP , and NP VP .
but even though NP VP , NNS NNS NN completely changed IN NP .
for me , this means that they &apos;re seeing the value of NP , NP .
but even more stri@@ king than the fer@@ o@@ cious power e@@ man@@ ating IN NP was the re@@ ck@@ less@@ ness with which that power was un@@ le@@ as@@ hed -- NP SBAR .
a range of explan@@ ations may be po@@ pping IN NP IN ADVP , IN NP . &quot;
NP VP , VBP NP ? -- RB , IN NP , DT VBZ NP .
ignor@@ e those cre@@ eping fe@@ ars that NP VP .
that &apos;s DT NN RB RB IN NP .
DT JJ NN VBZ VP .
NN : ... IN NP .
bf : NP VP , PRP VBZ NP . all right .
NN : INTJ , NP VP .
could PRP RB VBP NP ?
NN : NP SBAR .
NP PP VBZ NP .
dh : tell PRP IN NP .
and it &apos;s aw@@ fully win@@ dy IN ADVP .
because now , to make NP ADJP , we &apos;ll ju@@ g@@ gle the seven clu@@ bs back ...
i &apos;ll spend DT NN IN NP . i &apos;ve VP .
if NP VP , you &apos;ll VB NP . DT S there &apos;s NP SBAR .
now , some people call NP NP .
to VB NP NP , it had RB NN IN NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
according IN NP , in CD NNS all the mountain gl@@ aci@@ er will VB VP .
i launched NP VP .
you shouldn &apos; t worry about PRP . dad doesn NP VP .
it is IN NP .
we &apos;re only trying to VB NP .
NP VP .
NP , NP , NP , NP , CC NP VBZ NP .
so unfortunately , NP NP DT NN , but it does VB NP PP .
but NP SBAR VBZ VP .
RB , NP VP , and NP VP .
and so imagine one more thing : that that software is able to ask both par@@ ties for NP , NP would you be willing to meet your third cou@@ sin ? &quot;
NP NP RB IN NP . and PRP VBP NP ADVP .
RB WRB MD NP VP ? NN NN VBZ NP .
NP VP , NP VP , and NP VP .
and things can happen only if NP VP .
finally , there &apos;s NP PP .
so the electro@@ magnetic and we@@ ak forces are described by NP PP .
from this pattern , we already know DT NN NN IN NP . the way NP VP is very beautiful .
DT NN IN NP cor@@ respon@@ ds IN NP .
IN S , CC NP VP -- INTJ , NP VP .
but not wor@@ rying about r@@ ent allowed me to spend my time doing WP NP VP .
i don NP VP .
so it rema@@ ins for NP VP .
so it &apos;s pretty sad to find that chimpanze@@ es , like NP PP , are VBG NP .
NP VP ; NP VP .
NP VP -- and ADVP NP VP .
see the bri@@ ck wall as all these problems NP VP . it &apos;s a message of hope .
but -- oh , they &apos;re also working IN NP .
NP PP PRP MD VP .
VBP NP .
NP VP and NP VP .
we can cut DT NN -- NP NP IN NP and IN S , save our oceans , save our planet , save ourselves .
and yes , you also interact using NP , NP , ADVP .
my student pr@@ an@@ a@@ v , WP VP , like i said , DT NN IN NP .
but WRB NP VP , she didn NP VP .
it &apos;s up to us women , because NP VP .
ADVP , NP , VBP NP VP ?
well , today , i &apos;d like to show you that PP , NP VP .
RB NN VBZ VP .
that &apos;s not dir@@ ty enough . let &apos;s just sti@@ r that IN NP .
RB , IN NP , PRP VBD PRT NP .
so with just eight billion dollars , we can hit the mil@@ len@@ ni@@ um goal &apos;s target of hal@@ ving NP PP IN NP IN NP .
and NP VP it &apos;s VP .
DT NN VBZ NP .
up until now , the united states has been DT JJ NN IN NP .
VB NP PP .
diplo@@ ma@@ cy is about man@@ aging NP PP .
but RB CD JJ NN .
the other 90 percent is dic@@ t@@ ated IN NP .
we are progra@@ mm@@ ed for NP VP .
but NP PP VBZ NP .
DT NNS VBD NP .
it &apos;s simply a little saying NP VP .
they inst@@ antly knew WRB NP VP .
they take PRP$ NN RB IN NP .
PRP VBZ NP .
DT NNS VBP NP .
dan bu@@ et@@ t@@ ner : how to live to VB NP
i &apos;m curious about WRB NP VP and WRB NP VP , but also because i believe NP VP , and ADVP , NP VP our future will be made of .
electr@@ on@@ ics k@@ its are very powerful in IN S , but the con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts in@@ her@@ ent in NP NP S .
PRP VBD NP , i saw NP VP .
and i believe IN . i believe IN .
if NP VP , i have NP PP .
but i believe NP VP like right now , WRB NP VP , i don NP ADVP VP .
you can VB NP .
once he was there , &#91; NP VP .
and what i &apos;ve tried to do since PRP VBD NP i wanted to figure out a way to help NP VP , and can be taught , and can be understood .
they pass NN IN NP .
so i pac@@ ked NP , NP CC NP IN NP , and dro@@ ve RB PP , VP .
and i fac@@ ed NP PP .
NP VP , or VBD NP NP ?
NNP NNP : NP-TMP NP VP
we were so much bigger than NP PP .
NN VBZ NP . VP , VP . &quot;
and here is DT , NP VP .
RB PRP VBD , S . &quot;
of course i can . and they &apos;d VB NP ADVP ; i see NP VP , everywhere .
CD NN IN NP came IN NP .
and then we have NP , NP .
me@@ cha@@ i vi@@ ra@@ va@@ i@@ dy@@ a : how NN NN VBD NP NP
so i can VB NP , and i get NP HYPH NP HYPH NP IN NP .
NNS , NN .
there &apos;s a je@@ wish saying that NP VP .
RB , WHNP S -- NP PP -- VBZ NP .
now , how can you VB NP and VBP NP ?
ADVP NP VP , and ADVP , NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
NP VP , but ADVP NP VP .
does it make sense to participa@@ te IN NP ?
why not ? it is possible . look around in NP : NP .
PRP VBZ NP , and NP VP , and NP , PP , VP .
so WP NP VP is NP PP .
it &apos;s good IN NP . they make DT NN IN NP .
charles darwin and i and you broke off from DT NN NN from NP PP ago .
they &apos;re also very obs@@ essed IN NP .
NN NN : NP , NP , NP
and even though NP VP , we don S .
the answer is WP NP VP . &quot;
and , in NN , if NP VP , you can VB NP .
and this really is the moment when our relationship , both with NP , NP completely .
u@@ top@@ ia was actually a word that thomas NP VP .
ste@@ aming NP PP .
we need to realize that NP VP .
and the religi@@ ons that should VB VP are instead seen as NN IN NP .
i want NP VP .
kar@@ en arm@@ strong : let NP VP
NP VP , and NP VP .
if NP VP , you can VB NP .
sk@@ yl@@ ar ti@@ b@@ bits : can we make NP SBAR ?
and obviously there &apos;s been NP : NP , NP .
that as NP VP , we may VB NP .
and especially if you reg@@ ard NP PP VP , then they seem a little bit to NN IN NP .
now how do we know IN NP ?
we happen to VP , VP , NP PP .
NP VP , and NP VP !
the world is bu@@ z@@ zing IN NP VP .
so it has CC NP , CC NP , IN NP .
zo@@ om in IN NP , IN NP here .
but den@@ g xi@@ a@@ op@@ ing instin@@ c@@ tively understood NP PP .
we also need NP PP .
let NP VP .
they can VB NP PP .
let NP VP .
NP ADVP VP and NP VP , and PRP VBP NP PP , and RB VB NP ADVP PP .
i view that NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
after NP VP , the first step is RB VBG NP PP .
genom@@ ics pi@@ one@@ er NP VP .
DT NNS WHNP S sc@@ or@@ ed NP JJR IN NP .
NP VP , ADVP NP VP , or FRAG , NP VP .
S , CC S , but NP VP .
what about resources ? how are we going VP ?
in fact , just studying the r@@ ings alone , we stand to learn a lot about NP PP WDT NP VP .
it can VB NP PP . so stop and think IN NP .
it was significant for another reason . this is an international mission , and this event was cele@@ br@@ ated IN NP , IN NP , and the cele@@ br@@ atory pres@@ ent@@ ations were given IN NP , CC NP , CC NP CC NP .
this is an un@@ con@@ soli@@ d@@ ated ground that is suff@@ used IN NP .
my team and i have exam@@ ined images IN NP , and IN NP , and have thought about NP PP .
these leaders are trying to for@@ ge a massive national non@@ violent movement to VB NP and VB NP PP .
NN : NP VP .
but that &apos;s true IN NP too .
juli@@ a b@@ ach@@ a : pay NN IN NP
this is NP PP .
so epi@@ le@@ p@@ sy patients sometimes need NP PP .
so if PRP VBP NP -- ADVP NP VP and NP VP -- we know because PRP$ JJ NNS , WDT NP VP .
so if DT VBD VP , your memor@@ ies could start IN NP VP .
as NP VP , there &apos;s DT NN .
they &apos;re RB designed , simple VP and user friend@@ ly .
NP IN , NN VBD PRT PP .
NP VP , ADVP NP VP , and NP VP , &quot; NP VP , but PRP RB VBD S . &quot;
NP VP , and NP VP .
the next 3@@ 4 percent are NP , NP CC NP .
PRP VBZ NP .
how do PRP VB NP ?
leaders hold NP , CC NP .
the doctors , NP VP , try IN S .
so when PRP VBD NP PP , i knew NP VP .
and we cho@@ se to use NP PP .
what if NP VP .
and NP SBAR , PRP VBZ NP .
i believe that we all have a vision for NN IN NP .
what &apos;s wrong IN NP ?
the bad news is , NP VP .
you should say , &quot; that &apos;s od@@ d . i thought i read that NP VP . &quot;
when PRP VBD VP , he suddenly looked RP and said , NP , NP . &quot;
there was an article which was run IN NP , IN NP .
NNS NNS : NP NP
but NP VP -- ADVP NP VP . NP CC NP VBD PP . NP VP and NP VP .
u.n. opened their stati@@ stic dat@@ ab@@ ases , and we have a new version of the software up VP , so you don NP VP .
and DT VBD NP .
and look here -- compare to NP PP .
and now we can see that NP VP .
but NN IN NP .
this we can VB NP .
NP SBAR -- NP VP .
i would say that NP VP .
let NP NP .
so the RB JJ is JJ .
because NP VP i guess .
we can run the sc@@ ore up IN NP , and then get NP VP -- WHNP S .
and the chinese said IN NP , VP .
like sa@@ d@@ dam , IN NP , IN NP .
do you want VP ?
would you like NP VP ?
NP VP and NP VP .
can of NP , NP .
the rule is going to VB NP .
NP VP , PRP MD VP .
sh@@ inse@@ ki was right IN NP .
thanks .
really , we &apos;re VBG NP . really , not very much .
and the reason is , NP VP .
gave a bunch of physical reasons why it wouldn NP VP .
but then i found out that NP VP .
maybe another kno@@ b is NP PP .
NP VP : NP VP .
and that &apos;s NP PP IN S .
NP VP , and NP VP .
let NP VP . watch DT NN : JJ IN NP .
NP VP -- ADVP NP VP .
&quot; NP VP . PRP VBP S .
i used to be DT NN IN NP . i used to play PRP IN NP , you know .
but there &apos;s also wick@@ ed joy , NP VP .
at the opposite , everyone knows deep within NP NP IN NP , if IN NP , IN NP , we could VB SBAR .
NN , NP PP .
so that &apos;s WP NP VP .
so , i &apos;ve no time to go IN NP .
what is happiness , and how can we all get some ? bio@@ chem@@ ist turned budd@@ h@@ ist mon@@ k NP VP - being , to generate NP PP .
the environments NP VP , more typically , are like DT .
a public place so dis@@ mal that NP VP want to VB ADVP .
ok .
and we &apos;re not going to cure NP PP IN S .
so they take NP SBAR .
we &apos;re going to have to re-@@ learn WP NP VP .
please go out and do what you can to make this NP PP and NP SBAR .
the deeper NP VP , the more you run into NP PP .
here &apos;s DT NN IN NP .
i mean , i cut IN NP , and introduced NP : NP .
the government recently announ@@ ced plans to return IN NP IN NP .
so , what if you could get your gas at NP NP ?
NP VP and NP VP .
NP IN NP NNP VBD NP , i in@@ tend VP .
so i &apos;ve seen NN IN NP .
i mean , couldn &apos; t NP VP the virg@@ in brand for NP ADVP ?
NN : INTJ , NP VP . NP VP -- INTJ , S , S .
and then 24 months from now , people will be able to take DT NN IN NP .
and you inspired an ian m@@ ce@@ w@@ an novel NP VP .
NN JJ NN -- NP NP ?
do you look IN NP and think NP VP , we &apos;re going VP ...
that is JJ .
we need to try to encoura@@ ge people to come up with a way of extra@@ cting carbon out IN NP atmosphere .
NP VP , NP VP -- IN S and NP VP .
