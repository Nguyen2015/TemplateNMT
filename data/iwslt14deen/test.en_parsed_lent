you know , one of the inten@@ se pleas@@ ures of travel and one of DT NNS IN NP is the opportunity to live am@@ on@@ gst NP SBAR .
just to know that ja@@ gu@@ ar sh@@ am@@ ans still journey beyond the mil@@ ky way , or the my@@ ths of the in@@ u@@ it el@@ ders still res@@ on@@ ate with meaning , or that in the hi@@ mal@@ a@@ ya , the budd@@ hi@@ sts still pur@@ sue the breath of the d@@ har@@ ma , is to really remember the central re@@ vel@@ ation of NN , and that is the idea that the world in which we live does not exist in some absolute sense , but is just one model of reality , the con@@ sequence of CD JJ NN IN NP .
and RB RB , PRP DT VBP NP .
PRP VBP S . PRP DT VBP NP PP .
PRP VBP PP .
we have VP IN S , we all dance , we all have art .
but what NP ADJP is NP PP .
and whether it is the pen@@ an in DT NNS IN NP , or DT NN NNS IN NP , or DT NNS IN NP , DT NN IN NP , or DT NN IN NP -- DT VBZ ADVP NP her@@ der in the slo@@ pes of q@@ om@@ ol@@ ang@@ ma , ever@@ est , the go@@ dd@@ ess mother of the world .
all of DT NNS teach us that NP VP .
and DT VBZ NP .
now , together the my@@ ri@@ ad cultures of the world make up a web of JJ NN and cultural life WDT VP - being of the planet as indeed is the biological web of NN WHNP S .
and you might think of DT JJ NN IN NP as VBG NP , and you might define the eth@@ no@@ sphere as VP VBD PP .
DT NN VBZ NP .
it &apos;s NP PP .
and just as DT NN VBZ VP , so too is DT NN -- and , if NN , at DT ADJP NN .
no bi@@ ologists , for example , would d@@ are suggest that NP PP VP CC VP because PRP RB VBZ RB ADJP , and yet that -- the RBS JJ scen@@ ari@@ o in NP PP what we know VP .
and NP PP , RB RB , VBZ NP .
WHADVP S , EX VBD NP .
RB , DT NN VBZ RB ADVP NP .
DT NN VBZ NP .
PRP VBZ NP .
every language is NP PP .
and of those 6@@ ,000 languages , as PRP VBP ADVP NP-TMP PP , fully half are no longer being VBN PP .
they &apos;re RB RBR VBG VP .
what could be ADJP SBAR or anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ te DT NN IN NP ?
and yet , that dre@@ ad@@ ful fa@@ te is RB NP PP ADVP RB NP , because DT CD NNS , DT JJR NNS and VP the last sy@@ ll@@ ables of an ancient ton@@ gue .
and i know there &apos;s NP PP WHNP S , NN JJ NN S , NN JJ NN S ? &quot; and i say , &quot; great , let &apos;s make DT NN NN . let &apos;s make it c@@ ant@@ on@@ ese .
VB S . &quot;
and PRP VBP ADVP VP .
and so , what i &apos;d like TO VP is sort of take you on DT NN through NP , NP through DT NN , to try TO VP .
now , there are many IN NP .
take , for example , this child of NP PP .
now , this is a people WP ADVP VP .
PRP VBP NP : VP MD VP .
and this is DT VBN PP , yet the curious thing is in NP , SBAR .
NP ADVP VP and ADVP VP .
or , CD IN NP PRP RB VBD PP , DT NNS IN NP cont@@ ac@@ ted RB IN NP .
IN NP , CD NNS VP CC VP .
they dro@@ pped from the air QP JJ NNS IN NP IN WHNP NP VP .
they picked up these photographs from DT NN NN , tried to VB PP S , found nothing , and conclu@@ ded that DT VBD VP , so they spe@@ ared the five mis@@ sion@@ aries to death .
but DT NNS VBP NP .
PRP VBD NP .
NP PP VBD ADJP .
we tra@@ ced gene@@ alo@@ gi@@ es back eight generations , and we found two in@@ stances of JJ NN and when PRP VBD NP PP , they ad@@ mit@@ ted that NP VP , so we spe@@ ared him anyway .
but IN NP PRP VBD NP .
PRP$ NNS MD VP .
in the early &apos; 8@@ 0s , i had a really ast@@ on@@ ishing as@@ sign@@ ment when i was asked by PRP$ NN at NNP if i was interested in VP .
in order VP , i had TO VP . and vo@@ o@@ do@@ o is not a black magic cul@@ t .
IN NP , PRP VBZ NP .
PRP VBZ ADJP .
IN S , WP MD NP VP ?
NN , NN , NN , NN , WDT .
there &apos;s always one continent left out , the assu@@ mption being that sub-@@ sahar@@ an africa had DT JJ NNS . well , of course , they did and vo@@ o@@ do@@ o is simply the dist@@ il@@ lation of DT ADJP JJ NNS WHNP S .
but , WP VP is IN S .
RB , DT NN VB NP PP .
the spi@@ ri@@ ts can be inv@@ o@@ ked from bene@@ ath NP , VP .
that &apos;s WHADVP S .
PRP VP CC VP . &quot;
and IN S , PRP VBP VP ?
so you see these ast@@ on@@ ishing demon@@ stra@@ tions : vo@@ o@@ do@@ o ac@@ oly@@ tes in NP PP hand@@ ling burning em@@ bers with NP , NP .
now , of PDT DT NNS WHNP S , the most extraordinary are DT NNS IN NP .
des@@ cen@@ dan@@ ts of DT JJ NN NN WHNP S , in the wake of DT NN , these people re@@ treated into DT JJ JJ NN WHNP S .
IN NP , DT NNS JJ VBD ADVP VP .
IN NP , PRP VBP VP but NP PP VBZ ADJP .
the young ac@@ oly@@ tes are taken away from their families at the age of CD CC CD , sequ@@ e@@ ster@@ ed in NP PP at NP PP : two nine - year peri@@ ods deli@@ ber@@ ately cho@@ sen TO VP ; now they are metaph@@ or@@ ically in the wom@@ b of the great mother .
and for this entire time , they are in@@ cul@@ tur@@ ated into DT NNS IN NP .
and at the end of this amazing initi@@ ation , one day they &apos;re suddenly taken out and for the first time in their lives , at the age of 18 , they see a sun@@ rise . and in that cr@@ y@@ st@@ al moment of awareness of first light as the sun begins to ba@@ the the slo@@ pes of the stun@@ n@@ ingly beautiful landscape , suddenly everything they have learned in the abstra@@ ct is aff@@ ir@@ med in stun@@ ning gl@@ ory . and the pri@@ est steps back and says , &quot; you see ? it &apos;s really as i &apos;ve told you .
PRP VBZ SBAR . PRP VBZ NP S . &quot;
they call PRP S and they say S .
RB , NP PP VBZ ADJP .
whenever we think of JJ NNS and NN , we either inv@@ o@@ ke r@@ ous@@ se@@ au and the old can@@ ard of NP , CC S and say these people are ADJP PP IN S .
UH , JJ NNS VP CC VP .
there &apos;s not a lot of room for either in the malari@@ al s@@ w@@ am@@ ps of the as@@ m@@ at or in the chil@@ ling win@@ ds of ti@@ bet , but they have , ne@@ ver@@ th@@ eless , through time and ritual , for@@ ged a traditional my@@ sti@@ que of the earth that is based RB IN NP .
RB , WP VBZ NP VP ?
it means that a young kid from the and@@ es WP VP will be a pro@@ fo@@ und@@ ly different human being and have a different relationship to that resource or that place than a young kid from mon@@ tan@@ a raised to believe that NP VP .
IN S VBZ ADJP .
WHNP S VBZ NP .
PRP VBD VP .
that made me a different human being than my friends am@@ on@@ gst the k@@ wa@@ gi@@ ul@@ th who VBP SBAR and the can@@ ni@@ b@@ al spi@@ ri@@ ts that VBD PP .
now , if you begin VP , you could begin TO VP . take this plant here .
PRP VBZ NP .
DT VBZ NP , DT ADJP JJ NN IN NP &apos;s NN .
what makes ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca fascinating is not the she@@ er pharma@@ col@@ o@@ gical potential of this prepar@@ ation , but the el@@ abor@@ ation of it . it &apos;s made really of two different sources : on the one hand , this woo@@ dy li@@ ana which has in it a series of beta - carbolines , har@@ mine , har@@ mal@@ ine , mil@@ dly hallu@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic -- to take the v@@ ine alone is rather to have sort of blue ha@@ zy smo@@ ke dri@@ ft across your consciousness -- but it &apos;s mix@@ ed with the leaves of a s@@ hr@@ u@@ b in the coffee family called psych@@ ot@@ ri@@ a vi@@ ri@@ d@@ is .
DT NN VBD NP .
if you &apos;ve RB VBN NP S , SBAR .
to VB NP is rather like VP .
NP VP ; NP VP .
in fact , i used to argue with my professor , richard ev@@ an sh@@ ul@@ tes -- who is a man who spar@@ ked DT JJ NN IN NP IN NP -- i used to argue that you couldn NP VP .
but the thing about NNS is NP VP .
PRP MD ADVP VP .
now , the fascinating things are that NP VP . so you ask yourself a question .
how , in a fl@@ or@@ a of CD NNS IN NP , do these people find these two RB JJ plants WDT SBAR , VP ?
well , we use NP , NP .
but NP VP , and NP VP . &quot;
UH , WP VBZ NP VP ?
this tri@@ be , the co@@ fan , has CD NNS IN NP , NP WHPP NP VP .
and then you ask PRP WHADVP S .
NP VP , VBP NP SBAR ? NN CC PRP VBD , PP . &quot;
well , it turns RP S , and it s@@ ings IN NP IN NP .
RB , DT VBZ RB VP , but PRP VBZ S .
now -- -- the problem -- the problem is that RB NP PP VBP NP PP but RB VBN PP PP , S .
well , the truth is the 20th century , CD NNS from RB , is not going VP or passi@@ vely accep@@ ted DT JJ NN IN NP on DT NN . now , the problem isn &apos; t change .
NP PP VBP ADVP VP .
and DT NN VBZ RB NP .
the si@@ ou@@ x indi@@ ans did not stop VBG NP .
it VBZ RB VP or NP SBAR . it is NP , NP .
wher@@_ever you look around the world , you discover that these are not cultures dest@@_ined to fa@@_de away ; these are dynamic living peop@@_les being driven out of existence by identi@@_fi@@_able forces that are beyond their capacity to ada@@_pt to : whether it &apos;s the e@@_gre@@_gi@@_ous de@@_for@@_est@@_ation in the hom@@_eland of the pen@@_an -- a no@@_ma@@_di@@_c people from sou@@_the@@_ast asia , from sar@@_a@@_wa@@_k -- a people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago , and now have all been re@@_duced to ser@@_vi@@_tude and pro@@_stit@@_ution on the ban@@_ks of the ri@@_vers , where you can see the river itself is so@@_iled with the si@@_lt that seems to be carrying half of bor@@_ne@@_o away to the south china sea , where the japanese frei@@_gh@@_ters hang light in the hori@@_zon ready to fill their hol@@_ds with ra@@_w lo@@_gs ri@@_pped from the forest -- or , in the case of the y@@_an@@_o@@_mam@@_i , it &apos;s the disease enti@@_ties that have come in , in the wake of the discovery of gold .
or if PRP VBP PP , where PRP VBP S , you &apos;ll see S .
you know , geno@@ cide , DT JJ NN IN NP is RB VBN , but NN , NP PP , is not RB RB VBN , it &apos;s univer@@ s@@ ally , in many quar@@ ters , cele@@ br@@ ated as part of DT NN NN .
and PRP MD RB VP .
i once tra@@ v@@ ell@@ ed 6@@ ,000 miles from ch@@ eng@@ du in western china over@@ land through sou@@ the@@ astern ti@@ bet to l@@ has@@ a with DT JJ NN , and it was only when i got to VB SBAR .
DT JJ NN NNP NN VBD VP .
DT VBD SBAR .
PRP$ NN VBD PP PP .
PRP$ NN VBD VP .
he was s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ed IN NP VP .
DT NN WHNP S .
one day PRP RB VBD PP , and IN NP , PRP VBD VP .
NP PP MD VP , but NP PP VBZ NP .
and in the end , then , it really comes down to DT NN : do PRP VP CC VP ?
mar@@ gar@@ et me@@ ad , the great anthropo@@ log@@ ist , said , before she died , that her greatest fear was that as NP VP view CONJP MD NP VP , but that we would wake from DT NN CD NN having VBN SBAR .
and it &apos;s JJ S .
the ne@@ oli@@ th@@ ic revolution -- which gave us NN , WHPP S -- is only 10,000 years ago .
NP PP VBP SBAR .
now , that NP NP VBP PP SBAR .
WRB NP VP , they respond IN NP .
and it &apos;s within that song that PRP MD RB VP . and there are great moments of optimis@@ m .
this is DT NN S , and this man , ol@@ ay@@ u@@ k , told me DT JJ NN IN NP .
the can@@ adi@@ an government has not RB VBN ADVP , and during DT NNS , TO VP , we forced PRP IN NP .
DT JJ NN VBZ SBAR .
NP , ADJP , VBD PRT NP , NP .
ADVP , NP VP ; NP VP .
NP PP VBD ADVP VP .
RB , DT NN VBZ SBAR .
he simply sli@@ pped outside , pulled down his se@@ al@@ skin tr@@ ous@@ ers and de@@ fe@@ cated into PRP$ NN . and as the fe@@ ces began VP , he sha@@ ped it into DT NN IN NP .
he put NP PP IN NP and as NP ADVP VP , he bu@@ t@@ cher@@ ed DT NN IN NP .
he sk@@ inn@@ ed the dog and impro@@ vis@@ ed a har@@ ness , took DT NN IN NP and impro@@ vis@@ ed a s@@ led , har@@ n@@ essed up an ad@@ jac@@ ent dog , and disappe@@ ared over NP , NP .
VB PP .
and DT , IN NP : -- is NP PP .
the can@@ adi@@ an government in NP PP gave back to NP PP .
PRP VBZ NP . PRP VBZ VP .
PRP VBZ NP . PRP VBP NP .
DT JJ NN IN SBAR .
and finally , in the end , i think it &apos;s RB JJ PP , VP .
PRP VBP NP .
they represent bran@@ ches of DT JJ NN WHNP S . and for all of us , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of PRP$ JJ NNS , become part of DT JJ NN IN NP .
so , WP NP VP , finally , is , S .
we think that po@@ le@@ mi@@ cs -- -- we think that NNS VBP RB ADJP , but we think that NP VP , and so we are probably DT JJS NN NN IN NP . we get 35 million hits on our website every month .
CD NNS VBP NP .
PRP$ NNS VBP VP .
and what we &apos;re doing is a series of jour@@ ne@@ ys to the eth@@ no@@ sphere where we &apos;re going to VB NP PP SBAR : that this world deser@@ ves to exist in a diver@@ se way , that we can find a way to live in NP SBAR .
VBP NP ADVP .
what i &apos;m going to show PRP RB , as quickly as i can , is some foun@@ da@@ tional work , some new technology that we brought TO VP . this is se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on , and it &apos;s an environment in which you can either lo@@ cally or re@@ mot@@ ely interact IN NP .
we &apos;re VBG PP ADVP and RB VBG PP , VBG PP , VBG NP PP .
and it doesn JJ NN NN SBAR , SBAR CC SBAR .
most of PRP are ordinary digital camera photos , but DT NN , IN NP , is NP PP , and it &apos;s IN NP .
it doesn &apos; t make any difference because NP VP . it &apos;s also very flexi@@ ble architecture .
NP VP , so NP VP .
DT VBZ NP . DT NN VBZ NP .
to prove IN NP IN S , we can do something like RB , TO ADVP VP ; it &apos;s not a picture .
RB DT VBZ NP .
PRP VBP SBAR .
DT VBZ NP . DT VBZ NP .
DT JJ NN VBZ NP .
and this really gives you DT NN and NP PP .
PRP VBP ADVP VP .
we &apos;ve made RP NP SBAR IN S -- and we &apos;ve em@@ bed@@ ded extra content .
IN S , PRP MD VP .
or NP , CC NP .
and this really gets IN S .
we hope IN S .
RB RB , NN VBZ NP .
and this one NP ADVP VP .
but DT VBP NP .
VBN PP .
ADVP VP , RB , NN RB .
NP VP ; NP VP .
DT VBZ NP .
one of PRP is se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on and the other is DT ADJP NML NN VBN PP .
and NN NN IN NP . a RB JJ collaboration .
and RB DT VBZ ADJP . PRP VBZ VP .
you can see IN SBAR .
but NP PP RB VBZ ADVP ADJP .
the computer vision algorith@@ ms have regi@@ ster@@ ed these images together so that they cor@@ respond to NP SBAR . so you see elements here of stabili@@ zed NN HYPH NN or JJ NN , and these things have all been related spa@@ tially .
PRP VBP RB ADJP .
EX VBP NP .
i would like to jump straight to CD IN NP -- and this is from an early prototyp@@ e of photo@@ syn@@ th that we first got VBG PP -- to show you what PRP VBP SBAR . and it &apos;s not necessarily so appar@@ ent from looking at DT NNS that we &apos;ve put up on the website .
PRP VBD S .
this is a re@@ construction of not@@ re d@@ ame ca@@ the@@ d@@ ral that was VBN ADVP PP . you just type not@@ re d@@ ame into fli@@ ck@@ r , and you get some pictures of guys in NN HYPH NNS , and of NP CC ADVP . and each of these orange con@@ es represents an image that was discovered TO VP .
and ADVP NP VP , and NP VP .
and PRP MD ADVP VP .
NP VP , PRP RB VBD SBAR .
PRP VBZ ADJP S .
i guess NP VP : it &apos;s everything from NML NNS to NP , NP .
and IN S , PRP VBP VP .
NP PP VBP VP .
ADVP NP VP -- ADVP NP VP .
DT VBZ ADVP NP .
PRP MD VP .
what the point here really is is that we can do NNS IN NP . this is now taking data from NN -- from NP PP -- and link all of that together .
NP PP VBP VP , and PRP VBP NP .
PRP VBP NP .
NP PP VBZ NP .
and this is NP SBAR .
PRP$ JJ NNS VBP VP .
if somebody bo@@ ther@@ ed to tag all of these sa@@ in@@ ts and say who they all are , then my photo of not@@ re d@@ ame ca@@ the@@ d@@ ral suddenly gets en@@ rich@@ ed with all of that data , and i can use it as an ent@@ ry point to di@@ ve into that space , into that meta - verse , using everybody else &apos;s photos , and do a kind of a cros@@ s-@@ mod@@ al and cros@@ s-@@ user social experience that way .
and of course , a IN HYPH NP of DT IN NP is im@@ men@@ sely rich virtual models of DT JJ NN IN NP , colle@@ cted not just IN NP and IN NP , but from DT JJ NN .
VBP NP ADVP .
do i understand this right ? that what your software is VBG S , is that IN NP , NP SBAR VBP VP ?
yes . WHNP S VBZ VP .
PRP VBZ S .
and PRP VBZ S .
and that gets RB JJ WHADVP S .
like when you do NP , NP , CC NP is carrying DT NN IN NP about WHNP S .
RB , WP IN NP ?
then DT NN IN NP and NP PP WHNP S is really huge . it &apos;s a classi@@ c network effect .
NNP , DT VBZ ADJP . con@@ gr@@ at@@ u@@ lations .
NNS RB RB .
i &apos;m going TO VP , and i &apos;ll try TO VP , in case you miss them .
PRP VBP S . &quot;
DT JJ NN IN NP ?
DT JJ NN IN NP .
and the offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma runs IN NP : if NP VP , the way VP is VP .
DT NN IN NP is CC IN S .
and because IN S , RB NP PP MD VP , and no one has TO VP .
DT NN S VBZ S .
the more choice people have NP NP .
this , NP VP , is RB RB VBN PP .
and PRP VBZ ADVP VP .
PRP VBP S .
DT VBZ NP . not PDT DT JJ NN .
PRP VBP S .
17@@ 5 sal@@ ad d@@ res@@ s@@ ings in my super@@ market , if you don &apos; t count NP CC NP you could buy to make NP PP , PP IN S you .
RB DT VBZ SBAR .
and then you go to the NN NN store to VB PRT NP and in this one single consumer electr@@ on@@ ics store , there are that many stere@@ o systems .
PRP MD VP .
PRP VBP SBAR .
IN NP -- NP PP .
there was a time , WRB NP VP you wanted , ADVP IN S .
PRP VBD NP . PRP VBP S .
NP PP , IN NP , VBZ SBAR .
and DT NNS VBP VP .
PRP RB VBP NP , ADVP PP .
DT VBP NP .
PRP$ NN VP , CC VP .
and if IN NP NN JJ NN VBN SBAR .
and WHNP S VBZ SBAR .
and do PRP VB SBAR ?
DT NN VBZ ADJP NP . &quot;
PRP VBZ RB ADJP .
so , in NP PP , DT JJ NN IN NP is JJ .
health care -- PRP VBZ ADVP NP , and DT NN VBZ NP .
instead , you go IN NP , and the doctor tells NP , VP , we could VB NP , or we could VB NP .
DT VBZ NP .
NN VBZ NP . WP VBP NP VP ? &quot;
S , VP , WP MD NP VP ? &quot;
and the do@@ c says , VP .
WP VBP NP VP ? &quot;
S , NN , WP MD NP VP ? &quot;
CC NP VP but NP VP . &quot;
and the result is -- we call it &quot; patient autonom@@ y , &quot; which makes PRP VB PP , but what it really is is a shif@@ ting of the bur@@ den and the responsibility for NP PP , NP : PP and RB RB PP VP the patient .
there &apos;s enormous marketing of NP PP , WHNP S .
WRB VP NP SBAR ?
the answer is IN S .
NN IN NP has RB VBN NP , SBAR .
NP VP ; NP VP .
and PRP VBP PP .
and that means that ADVP , SBAR , NP VP .
with respect to marriage and family , there was a time WRB NP VP , and then you started having NNS RB RB as PRP MD .
NP VP , and RB SBAR .
RB , NN VBZ ADVP ADVP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
and PRP VBZ SBAR .
PRP VBZ SBAR should PRP VB SBAR ? should i get VBN ADVP ?
should PRP VB VP ? should PRP VB NP ? &quot;
NP PP VBP VP .
and they &apos;re VP CC RB VP .
and RB PRP MD . DT VBP NP .
work -- we are bl@@ essed , IN S , IN NP .
there is CD NN , PP , SBAR , SBAR .
PRP VBP RB VP .
so what this means , this incredible freedom of choice NP VP , is that we have VP .
we can go VP , and we have PRP$ NN NN IN NP , on PRP$ NNS .
and even if they &apos;re NP VP , we are also asking ourselves , NN MD NP VP ?
should PRP VB PP ? should PRP VB NP ? &quot;
and even if DT NN IN NP is JJ INTJ , VP it &apos;s certainly going TO VP .
RB RB S , JJ NNS and NP , NP is NP PP .
and NP SBAR .
NP VP , S , but NP VP .
and NP SBAR .
and DT NN VBZ , SBAR ?
and DT NN VBZ INTJ .
PRP DT VBP SBAR , so PRP VBP VP .
NP PP VBZ NP .
CD NN , RB , VBZ SBAR .
IN NP , NNS VBP S .
i &apos;ll VP .
a collea@@ gue of NN got access to NN NNS from NP , NP .
and WP NP VP is IN S .
NP VP -- NP VP . WRB ?
because IN NP VP , it &apos;s so dam@@ n hard TO VP .
and ADVP NP , CC ADVP NP , CC NP , and NN , and NML NN never comes .
understand that not only does this mean IN S , it also means IN S .
by RB VP , they are VBG PRT NP PP .
RB NN VBZ NP .
and PRP VBP SBAR .
PRP RB VBP S ?
PRP VBP SBAR .
so that &apos;s one effect . the second effect is that even if PRP VBP S , we end up ADJP SBAR .
and EX VBP NP .
one of them is that with a lot of different sal@@ ad d@@ res@@ s@@ ings to choose from , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and , you know , what sal@@ ad d@@ res@@ sing is ? -- it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have made a different choice WDT VP . and what happens is this imag@@ ined alternative indu@@ ces PRP TO VP , and this re@@ gre@@ t sub@@ tra@@ cts from DT NN you get out of the decision you made , even if it was a good decision .
the more NNS S is JJ PP WHNP S .
RB , WHNP S . &quot;
dan gil@@ bert made a big point this morning of VP .
well , when there are NP PP , it is easy TO VP .
RB VBZ DT NN . IN NP , PRP VBP .
but RB VBZ SBAR .
RB VB NP PP .
RB JJ JJ NN .
gor@@ ge@@ ous beach . beautiful day . PRP VBP NP PP .
what MD VP ? &quot; well , VB NP , VB SBAR , VB SBAR .
NP PP VBZ ADVP .
PRP MD VP . &quot;
and he sp@@ ends CD NNS VBN PP SBAR .
opportunity costs sub@@ tra@@ ct IN NP .
and the more op@@ tions NP VP are going VP .
RB VB NP .
RB DT NN VBZ NP .
PRP VBZ NP PP .
but CD NN S is IN S .
and DT JJ NNS MD VP , and PRP VBZ S .
ADVP : NN IN NP .
DT VBD NP SBAR .
PRP VBP NP ADVP .
and there was a time when NNS VBD PP , and NP VP , and S , CC S .
so i went TO VP , and i said , S , VP . here &apos;s my size . &quot;
S , NP VBP NP VP ?
PRP VBP S ? PRP VBP VP ?
do PRP VB S ?
NP VP ... S VP .
PRP$ NN VBD , and IN S , PRP VBD , SBAR . &quot;
he had DT NN WHNP S , so i spent DT NN VP , and i walked IN IN NP ! -- with the RBS HYPH VBG je@@ ans i had ever had .
PRP VBD ADJP . PDT DT NN VBD S .
but PRP VBD ADJP .
WRB ? PRP VBD NP S .
the reason NP VP is IN , IN NP available , my expec@@ tations about WHADJP S .
NP VP -- NP VP .
WHADVP S , NP PP MD VP .
and SBAR VP , but NP VP .
and so i compared SBAR , CC SBAR .
VBG NP PP &apos;s lives can VP CC VP .
and WP that NP VP .
NN IN NP knows DT , IN S .
DT NN VBZ ADVP PP .
the reason that NP VP is that SBAR , NP VP .
no@@ wa@@ days , the world PRP VBP PP NP is as good as PRP VBP S .
PRP MD ADVP VP .
DT NN IN NP -- DT S -- the JJ PP expec@@ tations .
i want VP , and she &apos;s RB RB JJ .
PRP VBP SBAR . PRP VBP S .
but VP NP NP .
finally , one con@@ sequence of buying DT ADJP NN IN NP is that when NP VP , and NP VP , the answer is clear : the world is responsible . what could you do ?
when NP VP , and S , CC S , who &apos;s JJ ?
PRP VBZ ADJP SBAR .
PRP MD VP .
IN NP , EX VBZ NP .
and RB SBAR , and RB IN S , PRP VBP ADJP ; they bl@@ ame PRP .
JJ NN VBZ VP .
i believe a significant -- not the only , but a significant -- contribu@@ tor to DT NN IN NP , and also su@@ i@@ cide , is that people have NP SBAR , and then when they have TO VP , they think they &apos;re at NN .
and RB DT JJ NN VBZ SBAR .
RB VB S .
this is NP , NP , and it &apos;s NP ADJP . it is not true .
there NNS DT NN that NP VP , but it doesn NP VP .
RB NP NP . PRP VBP SBAR .
PRP VBP ADJP SBAR .
now , as a policy matter : S : as DT NN NN , the thing to VB ADVP is this : what VBZ SBAR .
there are NP PP , and we have VBN PP , SBAR .
PRP$ NN VBZ SBAR .
RB NP SBAR VBZ NP .
and what is RB JJ CC JJ is this : NNP NNP VBD PP NP-TMP PP . it &apos;s a waste of NN .
WP NP VP is IN S .
PRP RB VBD .
PRP RB VBP S .
if DT IN SBAR were VBN PP those people &apos;s lives be impro@@ ved , but ours would be impro@@ ved RB .
DT VBZ SBAR . &quot;
income re@@ distribution MD VP -- RB NP -- PP PP .
so to conclu@@ de . you &apos;re supposed VP ! what does this fish know ?
NP VP , NN VBZ ADJP . &quot;
JJ NN , NP PP &apos;s NP SBAR .
the more i thought IN NP , RB , ADJP SBAR .
because NP PP VBZ SBAR , you don NP VP . you have paraly@@ sis .
IN S , PRP VBP NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
NN VBZ NP .
NP VP -- FRAG , FRAG .
but NP VP , and , NP VP .
VBP NP ADVP .
you know , i &apos;ve VBN PP PP : PP , and disco@@ vering NP PP .
we &apos;re actually starting IN NP : we &apos;ve VBN VP , and now we &apos;re VP .
RB , PRP VBP ADVP VP .
&quot; WHNP S ? &quot; is NP SBAR .
PRP VBP VP .
we &apos;ve been VBG NP ADVP PP ; when PRP VBD NP , it was going IN NP IN NP .
now we &apos;re VP ? &quot;
this is the map of NP , SBAR , and we &apos;ve been trying VP .
we &apos;re JJ S .
when we look PP , NP VP -- trust PRP , DT VBZ ADJP -- but when we look at NP SBAR , it &apos;s very un@@ likely that this would y@@ i@@ el@@ d DT NN NN .
so we decided NP ADVP VP .
and RB PRP VP : SQ
can NP VP ?
CC SBAR , MD NP VP ?
NP , PP , VBZ ADVP NP .
RB , NP PP VBZ VP .
our ability VP VBZ VP but VBZ VP , and our lat@@ est point would VB NP PP .
PRP VBD NP PP PP .
PRP VBD NP , PP , S .
but PRP VBZ PRT SBAR .
there are NP PP -- NP PP -- and it &apos;s a de@@ generate process , so the longer you make the piece , DT JJR NNS S .
RB PRP VBD S .
and DT VBD NP , PP .
PRP VBZ NP .
PRP VP , VP CC VP .
the exciting phase came WRB NP VP , and the bacteria started VP , made DT JJ NNS .
DT JJ NNS RB VP CC VP CC VP .
NP VP and NP VP .
PRP VBD SBAR .
and so , we think S .
but we wanted to go much larger : we wanted to build the entire bacteri@@ al chromo@@ some -- it &apos;s over 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 letters of genetic code -- so we thought we &apos;d build PRP IN NP IN S .
NN VBZ ADJP , and IN S VBZ S .
WRB NP ADVP VP , DT NN IN NP was NP PP .
we actually found , PP , NP ADVP VP .
part of the design is designing NP SBAR WHNP S .
PRP VBP NP PP .
PRP MD VP .
NP : S -- NP , NP .
tri@@ ple@@ ts of NP PP .
RB PRP MD VP .
RB , DT PRP VBD SQ .
DT NNS VBD VP .
PRP VBD NP SBAR ; EX VBP NP .
and we started VP , VP , put those together TO VP , then put NNS IN NP .
at each stage , we grew up these pieces in NN so PRP MD VP .
PRP VBP VP .
RB , DT VBZ PP .
when we get IN NP , they won &apos; t any longer VB ADVP PP -- it ex@@ hau@@ sts all the modern tools of JJ NN -- and so we turned to other mechanis@@ ms .
we knew S .
RB VBZ NP PP : EX VBZ NP .
NP VP , PRP$ NN RB VBZ VP .
NP RB , PRP VBD NP ADVP .
PRP VBP NP .
NP VP ; NP VP .
i am RB JJ SBAR .
IN NP , NNP VBZ VP .
here &apos;s an actual micro@@ graph of NP SBAR we put them in ; ye@@ ast puts them together auto@@ matically .
NP VP ; NP VP .
PRP VBZ NP .
DT VBP NP .
RB , DT VBZ NP .
DT VBZ PP ; PRP VBZ NP .
PRP VBZ PP .
if NP VP , it takes CD NNS RB IN NP .
UH , WRB VBP NP VP ? WRB VBP NP VP ?
RB , PP NP VP ; NP VP .
it &apos;s also simpl@@ er WRB NP VP : you can RB VB PRT NP , and that &apos;s WHNP S .
with bacteria and arch@@ a@@ e@@ a , the chromo@@ some is integr@@ ated IN NP , but we recently showed that NP VP .
we pu@@ ri@@ fied a chromo@@ some from one micro@@ bi@@ al species -- roughly , these two are as dist@@ ant as human and mi@@ ce -- we ad@@ ded a few extra genes so we could sele@@ ct for DT NN , we di@@ gest@@ ed it with enzy@@ mes to kill all the proteins , and it was pretty stun@@ ning when we put this in the cell -- and you &apos;ll appreci@@ ate our very sophisti@@ cated graphi@@ cs here .
DT JJ NN VBD PP .
IN NP , PRP VBD SBAR , but PRP VBD S .
DT VBZ NP ADVP .
we find DT NNS IN NP .
so , NNS WHNP S have VBN ADVP .
EX VBP NP .
NP VP ; NP VP .
PRP VBD VP and PRP VP , VP , and so we ended RP RB IN NP .
PRP VBD ADJP SBAR .
and with DT ADJP NN IN NP , all the characteri@@ stics of CD NNS were lost and it conver@@ ted totally into DT JJ NNS based IN NP .
PDT DT NN VBD , SBAR ; WHADVP S , PRP VBZ SBAR .
RB , DT MD VP , but PRP MD , PP , VP .
now NP VP , NP VP ; this is VBG PP .
and i &apos;ve VP .
WRB VB NP ?
PRP VBP SBAR .
PRP VBP ADVP S .
VP : NP VP .
there are RB NP SBAR ; within CD NNS , there &apos;ll VB NP .
we have NP VP .
PRP VBZ S .
we use IN NP NP PP : SBAR .
WRB NP VP , it &apos;s VP .
RB RB RB , EX VBZ NP .
we now , from PRP$ NN IN NP , have DT NN IN NP , and i like TO VP .
the electr@@ on@@ ics industry only VBD NP , and VB PP .
PRP VBP VP .
we now have NP , SBAR , VP .
PRP VBP ADVP S .
when you think of VP CC VP , we can just with a small team , do more molecular biology than the last 20 years of all science .
and PRP VBZ NP : PRP MD VP .
this is DT NN NN IN NP .
PRP VBP , SBAR : PRP VBP SBAR .
PRP VBP S .
NP VP , NP PP VBZ ADVP NP .
we have NP SBAR WHNP S .
but the only way we think IN S is if we start IN NP IN NP , and so we &apos;re working with VP .
and PRP VBP NP SBAR .
NN CC NN VBZ NP ...
but IN NP , PRP VBP NP .
DT VBZ NP .
PRP VBZ PP , PP .
PRP VBZ NP PP .
we &apos;re looking VP .
so , in DT JJ NN IN NP , we think that NP VP ? &quot;
we truly , you know , have mo@@ dest goals of VP . if you can VB SBAR , where can you ? -- become a major source of NN ...
but also , we &apos;re RB VBG PP .
NP VP ; NP VP and DT NN JJ WRB NP VP .
PRP VBP SBAR .
here &apos;s WP NP VP .
we &apos;re a ways away from VP : our goal is just TO VP . thank you very much .
JJ NN IN NP PRP VBD NP PP .
and PRP VBD S .
so this is it . and for NP PP WHNP S , the l@@ h@@ c is NP ADJP -- NP PP .
its job is TO VP .
PRP VBZ NP .
DT VBZ NP .
PRP VBP SBAR .
this is NP SBAR . it &apos;s VBN NP .
JJ NN RB IN NP IN NP .
IN NP JJ NN PRP VBD NP PP .
and DT NN VBD VP .
PRP VBD NP PP .
it &apos;s DT NN IN NP VP , VP , CC VP .
in JJ NNS , WRB NP VP , which is DT JJ NN .
i don NP VP .
PRP VBZ SBAR .
about DT NN RB S , VBN ADVP PP ADVP -- DT NN NNS .
DT NNS VBP NP .
now DT NNS IN NP will VP CC VP , VP . they &apos;re JJ NNS . &quot;
PRP MD VP .
so IN NP 2@@ 7@@ 1 degrees , ADJP PP , those wir@@ es can VB NP .
IN NP , EX VBD NP .
RB NP VP , and NP ADVP VP .
DT VBD NP .
RB DT VBZ ADJP SBAR , and PRP VBD NP .
RB PRP VBD NP .
PRP VBD S .
PRP VBD S .
PRP VBP NP ADVP ADVP .
IN NP DT NN MD VP .
we will switch PRP IN , and we expect TO VP .
now of course , in a way those acci@@ dents rei@@ gni@@ te DT NN IN NP at DT NN . it &apos;s easy VP .
i think that NP VP .
i will leave the final word to an english scientist , hum@@ ph@@ re@@ y da@@ vy , who , i sus@@ pe@@ ct , when defen@@ ding his prote@@ ge &apos;s us@@ eless experiments -- his prote@@ ge was michael far@@ a@@ day -- said this , &quot; nothing is so dangerous to the progress of the human mind than to assu@@ me IN S , IN S , IN S , and IN S . &quot;
VBP NP .
PRP VBP NP .
NP VP but NP VP .
PRP VBZ ADVP NP .
and PRP VBP SBAR .
but , that said , something kind of pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar has happened recently IN NP and IN NP .
and the pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar thing is that i recently wrote DT NN , NP VP .
WHNP S , NNS VBP NP SBAR .
RB -- VP !
like , they come RP IN NP now , all worried , and they say , &quot; NN JJ NN S : S JJ you &apos;re never going VP ?
aren &apos; t NP ADJP and NP VP going to VB NP ? &quot;
RB SBAR , PRP VBP .
but it would be worse , except for that i happen TO VP .
and NNS MD VP ?
NN JJ NN NP ADJP ?
aren &apos; t you afraid that PRP VBP VP and nothing &apos;s ever going TO VP and you &apos;re going TO VP ? &quot;
IN NP , PRP VBP .
NP : S , NP INTJ . &quot;
UH , PRP VBP ADJP .
and PRP RB VBP VP .
and PRP VBP ADJP .
UH NP SBAR .
but , when PRP VBZ PP , the thing WDT NP VP , is WRB ?
NP VP , VBZ NP ADJP ?
is it logi@@ cal that NP VP .
you know , and what VBZ NP ADVP NP , you know ?
like PRP$ NN , for NN , was DT NN NN and i don JJ NN NN RB IN NP , you know ?
PRP VBD NP ?
NP ADVP VP , PRP VBP ?
but TO VP , JJ NNS IN NP really ear@@ ned NP PP IN S .
we wri@@ ters , we kind of do VB NP , and not just wri@@ ters , but creative people across DT NNS , PRP VBZ , have DT NN IN S .
and all you have VP is look at NP PP , PP ?
and RB DT NNS WHNP S , you know .
nor@@ man ma@@ il@@ er , just before PRP VBD , NP , he said &quot; S . &quot;
NP VP , PRP VBP .
but we don &apos; t even blin@@ k when PRP VBP S and somehow we &apos;ve completely intern@@ alized and accep@@ ted colle@@ c@@ tively this notion that creativity and suffering are somehow in@@ her@@ ently lin@@ ked and that arti@@ stry , in DT NN , will always ultimately lead IN NP .
and DT NN WHNP S is VBP NP NP ?
are you comfortable IN NP -- i &apos;m not IN DT JJ PP .
PRP VBP SBAR .
and i also think S .
PRP VBP SBAR .
and i definitely know that , in PRP$ NN -- IN NP -- it would be RB JJ IN S , ADVP VBN NP .
WDT VP , i &apos;m NP JJ .
PRP RB VBP ADVP VP .
and it &apos;s ex@@ ce@@ ed@@ ingly likely that NP SBAR RB VBZ VP ?
i should RB VB NP ADVP , SBAR -- it &apos;s RB JJ IN S .
UH , ADVP NP , WHNP NP !
you know that VP , and i don NP VP .
PRP MD VP .
and RB , DT NN VBZ , ADVP ?
and so , it seems to me , upon DT NN IN NP , that NP , VP ?
i have to sort of find NP , CC NP , IN ADVP .
and , as i &apos;ve been looking over the last year for NP PP i &apos;ve been sort of looking across time , and i &apos;ve been trying to find other societies TO VP .
and DT NN VBZ VP .
RB VB PP , SBAR .
but , JJ NP CC NP -- NP VP , ADJP ?
people believed that NP VP .
DT NNS RB VBD NP . &quot;
NNS , RB , VBD SBAR .
NP VP , but NP VP .
WDT VP .
they believed that a geni@@ us was this , sort IN NP , who was believed IN ADVP PRN NP , and who would VB PRT and RB RB RB VB NP PP and would shape the out@@ come of that work .
so brilliant -- there it is , RB RB , IN NP .
and NN VBD SBAR ?
so the ancient artist was VBN PP ?
if PRP$ NN VBD ADJP , everybody knew that NP VP .
IN S , RB RB PRP$ NN , PRP VBP ?
NN VBD SBAR .
and DT VBZ SBAR .
and then the ren@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ ance came and everything changed , and we had this big idea , and the big idea was let NNS VP , CC ADVP VP .
and PRP VBZ NP , and NNS VBD S .
and for DT JJ NN IN NP , you start TO VP .
and PRP VBD S .
you know , i think that allo@@ wing somebody , one m@@ ere person to believe IN S , like DT NN and DT NN and DT NN IN NP is just a s@@ mi@@ dge too much responsibility to VB PP fra@@ gi@@ le , human psy@@ che .
PRP VBZ PP .
NP ADVP ADVP VP , and NP VP .
and PRP VBP SBAR .
and , if S , CC S , DT NN VP , VP ?
can PRP VB NP ADVP ?
RB VB ADVP PP .
RB not .
RB PRP MD VP .
and there &apos;s RB NP PP who MD VP .
NP VP , RB , VP .
but NP SBAR VBZ : S ?
WRB RB VP ?
because NP VP i have RB VBN PP .
a process WDT , PP , VP does not RB be@@ have RB .
and , IN NP , MD ADVP VP .
i had this en@@ counter recently where i met the extraordinary american po@@ et ru@@ th stone , who VBZ ADVP PP , but she &apos;s been a po@@ et her entire life and she told me that when PRP VBD VP , she would be IN S , and she said NP VP .
and PRP VBD SBAR .
and PRP MD VP .
and PRP VBD NP S , SBAR .
she knew IN S , and that was TO , IN NP , NP PP . &quot;
and she would run like hell to the house and she would be getting ch@@ ased IN NP , and the whole deal was that she had TO VP so that SBAR , NP VP .
and other times she wouldn &apos; t be fast enough , so PRP VBD VP , and PRP VBZ S and the po@@ em would NP PP and she would VB NP and she said S , as she put it &quot; for DT NN . &quot;
and then there were NP PRN SBAR , right ?
so , she &apos;s running to DT NN and she &apos;s looking for DT NN and the po@@ em pas@@ ses through her , and she grab@@ s a pen@@ cil just as it &apos;s VP , and then she said , it was like she would reach RP IN NP and she would catch it .
PRP MD VP , and PRP MD VP .
and in these in@@ stances , the po@@ em would come RP PP CC ADVP , PP IN NP .
so WRB NP VP .
NP VP -- NP VP !
i &apos;m a mu@@ le , and the way WDT NP VP is that NP VP really aw@@ k@@ war@@ dly .
but RB PRP , IN NP , RB PRP VBP VP .
and PRP MD VP .
PRP VBP , RB PRP VBP VP or NNS VBP PP PP .
and WP VBZ NP ?
and how are we TO VP ?
and for me , the best con@@ temporary example that PRP VBP PP wa@@ its , who PRP VBD S .
and we were talking about this , and you know , tom , for most of his life he was pretty much the em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment of the tor@@ mented con@@ temporary modern artist , trying to VB CC VB and VB NP .
but then he got JJR , he got JJR , and one day he was VBG PRT NP PP , and this is WRB NP ADVP VP .
and he &apos;s spee@@ ding along , and all of a sudden he he@@ ars this little frag@@ ment of NN , DT VBZ PP SBAR , el@@ u@@ sive and tan@@ tali@@ zing , and he wants it , you know , it &apos;s gor@@ ge@@ ous , and he lon@@ gs for it , but he has no way to VB NP .
PRP VBD SBAR , PRP VBD SBAR , PRP VBD SBAR .
so he starts TO VP , and then i &apos;m going VP .
NP VP , and NP VP . &quot;
and RB IN S , PRP RB VBD .
NP ADVP VP and NP VP .
PRP RB VBD PRT PP , and PRP VP , NP ? &quot;
NNP do PRP VB SBAR ?
if NP ADVP VP , come RB IN NP .
RB , VB VP .
VB VP . &quot;
and PRP$ JJ NN NN VBD PP .
NP , NP VBD ADVP PP PP .
but the process , and the heavy an@@ x@@ iety around it was rele@@ ased when he took DT NN , DT NN IN PP WHADVP S , and rele@@ ased PRP ADVP SBAR .
it could be NP PP .
so WRB NP VP it started VP , and it already saved PRP RB .
this idea , it saved me when i was in the middle of VBG SBAR and i fell into one of those , sort of p@@ its of des@@ pair that PRP DT VBP PP and it &apos;s not coming and you start to think this is going VP , this is going to be the worst book ever written .
RB ADJP , but NP VP .
and PRP VBD S .
but ADVP NP VP and NP VP .
RB PRP RB VBD NP PRT PP and PRP VBD NP PP .
and i said RB , &quot; listen PRP , NN , PRP CC PRP DT VBP SBAR ?
because NP VP , i don S .
RB if NP VP , then you &apos;ve S .
JJ but IN S .
PRP VBP VP .
and i would VB PP S . &quot;
because -- in the end NP VP -- cent@@ u@@ ries ago in DT NNS IN NP , people used to ga@@ ther IN NP .
and NP VP , ADJP ?
but DT UCP , NN MD VP , and NP PP MD ADVP VP .
and i know PRP VB SBAR , because NP VP .
it was like NP VP , and the dan@@ cer would RB RB VB PP and he wasn NP VP , NP IN , but everything would al@@ ig@@ n .
CC NP , PRP MD ADVP VP .
NP VP and NP VP .
and WRB NP VP , they called PRP IN NP .
they would VB NP ADVP and they would VB S . &quot;
NP VP , PRP VBP .
curious histor@@ ical foot@@ note -- when the mo@@ ors inv@@ aded JJ NNP , they took this cu@@ sto@@ m with them and the pr@@ on@@ un@@ ci@@ ation changed over DT NNS IN NP to VB NP SBAR .
in spa@@ in , when a perfor@@ mer has VBN UCP , NP-TMP , there it is -- a gli@@ mp@@ se of NN .
WDT VP .
but , the tri@@ cky bit comes DT JJ NN , IN NP , and he &apos;s no longer DT NN IN NP .
PRP VBZ ADVP NP , and RB PRP VBZ ADVP VP .
and maybe nobody will ever ch@@ ant NN NNS NN RB SBAR , CC SBAR ?
DT VBZ ADJP .
DT VBZ NP .
but maybe it doesn JJ NN VBP S .
but maybe if you just believed IN S .
and , S PRP VBZ S .
this is how i &apos;ve VBN S , and this is certainly how i &apos;ve VBN VP , as the RB , RB JJ follow RP IN NP .
and what i have VP .
VB NP VP .
RB VB NP .
VB S .
IN S , VB NP .
if NP VP VBZ S , then &quot; o@@ le ! &quot;
and SBAR , VP .
and VB ADJP ! VB PP .
NP VP and NP VP .
&quot; JJ ! &quot; PP , RB PP .
VBP NP .
VBP NP .
o@@ le !
last year i showed these two sli@@ des so that demon@@ strate IN S .
but DT VBZ NP SBAR .
DT JJ NN NN VBZ , PP , NP .
PRP VBZ PP PP .
DT JJ NN S happened IN NP .
DT JJ NN VBZ VP .
IN S , PRP VBZ PP , and PRP VBZ PP .
NP , NP , S is RB IN NP , VBG PRT PP ADVP .
IN NP PRP VBZ VP .
this is a problem because DT NN VBZ PRT NP .
compared IN NP , that amount could VB SBAR .
ADVP IN NP , NN VBZ ADVP VP .
NP PP VBD PRT PP PP NP-TMP .
who@@ a !
PRP VBZ ADJP . DT NN VBZ SBAR .
and CD NN VBZ , SBAR .
DT VBZ NP .
but DT NNS VBP ADJP .
DT VBZ NP .
if NP VP this is WHADVP S .
DT NNS VBP VP .
IN NP , NNP NP PP .
JJ NN NNS VBD SBAR .
and RB JJ VP , VP .
DT VBZ ADJP PP , ADVP .
in the hi@@ mal@@ ay@@ as , the third largest mass of NN : at DT NN you see NP , SBAR .
NP PP VBP NP PP .
IN NP , DT NN VBZ NP .
DT NNS VBP VP .
but WHADVP S , RB VBZ ADVP .
IN NP RB VBZ VP .
DT VBZ VP .
and NP , SBAR , VBP ADJP .
NP VP VBZ VP .
and NP PP VBP VP .
QP PP as IN NP .
DT VBZ NP .
IN S PRP MD VP .
in DT JJ CD NNS we &apos;ve VBN NP PP .
look carefully at NP PP , from NP , VP , and on NP PP .
NP , ADVP , WHNP S , is NP PP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
DT JJ NNS VBZ NP .
and DT NN VBZ VP .
but PRP VBP VP .
RB VBP NP SBAR .
RB EX VBZ NP .
and the coal industri@@ es and the oil industri@@ es spent DT NN IN DT CD dollars in NP VP .
DT NN VBD NP PP .
RB NNP , IN NP , NP PP VBD VP .
PRP RB VBD NP PP .
NP , RRC , VBZ NP .
DT VBD PP .
NP PP PP VBD NP .
ADJP DT NN NN VBZ NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
ADJP DT NN NN VBZ VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
DT VBZ NP .
DT JJS NN NN VBZ NP .
let NP VP . NNP VBP , NNP NNP , NNP NNP , NP VP .
RB NP PP VBZ VP .
DT VBZ NP .
IN NP PRP VBP NP PP .
that &apos;s WRB NP VP .
DT NN VBZ , NP .
PRP VBP SBAR .
RB VB NP PP .
VB NP PRT PP .
JJ NN -- NP VP .
RB VB S .
amazing ! DT NN VBZ ADJP .
but DT VBZ NP .
and while NP VP you see RB NNS NN .
VP : NP VP .
RB , DT JJ NN VBZ PP .
NN VBZ PP .
DT NN WHNP S : PRP$ NN IN NP .
but RB EX VBZ NP .
VB NP PP PP .
DT NN S VB NP .
RB , NP SBAR .
VB NP . VB PRT NP .
DT VBZ NP .
PRP VBZ PP .
CD IN NP VP .
JJ NNS IN ADVP . NN , NN , DT JJ NN NN .
JJ NNS S .
VB NP . PRP VBZ NP S .
RB VBZ NP .
IN S , VB ADVP . &quot;
PRP VBP S .
VBP NP ADVP .
i want VP .
as you figured RP WHADVP S , you were actually learning WRB VP .
JJ NN VBZ ADVP VP .
so , as a computer scientist inspired by this u@@ tili@@ ty of our inter@@ actions with physical objects -- along with my ad@@ vis@@ er pat@@ tie , and my collabor@@ ator je@@ ev@@ an kal@@ ani@@ th@@ i -- i started to wonder -- what if when we used DT NN , RB IN S we wanted ?
DT NN VBD ADJP SBAR .
IN NP , DT NN VBZ NP .
they &apos;re JJ S , they can VB NP , they can VB NP , and they have NP CC NP .
most importantly , PRP VBP ADJP , so IN NP , PRP MD VP .
and NNS VBP NP .
and as these tools become RBR JJ , RBR JJ PP , JJ PP , and JJ of NP PP , we can start to VB NP .
RB , PRP VBP VP .
this si@@ ft@@ able is VBN S , and if NP VP , it &apos;ll NN NP NP ; if PRP VBP S it roll@@ s it back@@ wards .
and DT JJ NNS VBP ADJP .
ADVP IN S , PRP VBP ADJP .
IN S , PRP VBP SBAR .
and PRP MD ADVP VP .
one of DT JJ NNS IN NP , we started VP , was that PRP MD VP .
so in DT NN , we &apos;ve S and i can VB S , SBAR .
IN S , PRP MD VP .
there are also some ne@@ at possibilities for NN , like NP SBAR .
ADVP NP VP -- NP VP .
RB PRP VBP NP .
basically , in DT NN you get NP PP , and as NP VP it che@@ cks IN NP .
then , IN NP , PRP VBZ , and PRP VBP NP .
VBP NP .
so these are NP SBAR , and i managed VP .
PRP RB VBD NP .
and , NP VP &apos; t have VP .
NP VP and NP VP .
RB RB VBZ NP VP .
DT VBZ NP PP .
VP , NP SBAR VBD S .
RB PP , PRP VBD ADVP NP .
RB , DT VBZ NP .
and PRP VBD S .
and DT VBZ NP , ADVP .
and he can VB NP PP , PP .
RB , PRP VBZ S .
DT NN VBZ VP .
RB PRP VBZ VP .
the orange tra@@ ctor .
good job ! yeah !
so IN S he can VB SBAR !
VBG NP .
hell@@ o !
NP VP , and NP VP .
VB ADVP , NP .
so , the last example PRP VBP NP is a music sequen@@ cing and live NN NN WHNP S .
NP VP , PRP VBP S .
and PRP MD VP .
and PRP VBP NP PP .
EX VBP NP .
PRP VBP NP PP S .
and NP SBAR .
RB VB S .
we &apos;ll VP , VP , VP , VP .
RB PRP VBD NP PP .
RB PRP VBP VP .
and ADVP NP VP , so NP VP .
PRP MD VP .
and RB PRP VBP VP .
PRP MD VP .
RB PRP VBP SBAR , but PRP MD VP .
and now , finally , i can VB NP PP .
VBP NP .
so , as PRP MD VP , my passion is for VP .
and today , i had NN S , and NP PP .
so the thought PRP VBP S is that PRP VBP PP PP .
VBP NP ADVP .
PRP VBP ADVP PP .
UH , UH .
PRP VBP ADJP .
UH , RB , WP VBZ VP ?
PRP VBP SBAR .
i study molecular biology and have been VBG NP PP ADVP , i started doing this because i simply VBD S and RB VBD S .
RB DT VBD NP .
S CC S , DT VBD NP .
i think that NP PP , NN WHNP S .
VP VP CC VP .
EX VBP NP .
now RB &apos;s NN NN IN NP NN , NP VP .
and then there are things that VBP ADVP VP .
and DT NN MD VP .
and RB IN PP , PRP VBD VP .
RB WHNP ADVP NP ?
NP PP VBP SBAR .
NN NN , and ADVP IN NP it &apos;s INTJ , NP VP .
that &apos;s rather sad IN NP fully describe SBAR CC SBAR .
NP VP and NP VP .
and PRP VBZ PP PP .
and a problem , so not only a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can also just be an access problem that simpli@@ fying NNS , so any way of VBG PP , of pos@@ ing DT NN , asking WHADVP S or better .
and it was PRP VBD PP , but PRP VBZ ADVP VP .
and so now you find it in biology , and i &apos;d like to take a metaphor from JJ NN , biology is actually an information science because the dna code is an abstra@@ ct code that UH , PRP VBZ RB PP , SBAR , i mean real material , and not just cyber@@ ne@@ tic .
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can program DT and so you can also ha@@ ck IN NP , that &apos;s it , and i thought VB S .
NP NP VBP S .
there &apos;s NN NN NN , WHNP S , and it &apos;s DT NN VBN PP , but it has NNS and NP PP by RB .
those are it has DT ADJP NN , IN S , there are museum exhi@@ bi@@ tions and , well , all sorts of things .
but the point is VP .
and RB RB NNS S HYPH NP , NN NN .
that &apos;s NP PP , that &apos;s NP , SBAR WHADVP S .
they are VBN PP , and so you see NP , INTJ , NP .
based IN NP , a scene came IN NP , WHNP S .
this picture on DT NN is of JJ , that &apos;s DT NN , so NP PP , DT JJ NN , DT JJ NN NN , where NN MD VP .
children , el@@ der@@ ly people , all sorts of NNS go there to simply VB NP PP , SBAR and VB PP .
here in NP VP it &apos;s VBN , but they &apos;ve VBN ADVP PP .
for NP PP .
they VBP PP , and VB NP .
a group from ank@@ ar@@ a , that PRP VBD PP SBAR are a student group that wanted VP , and they organis@@ ed these these little actions at street festi@@ v@@ als and tried to explain NN IN NP .
and in DT JJ NN IN NP i have a lec@@ ture in IN NP .
and that &apos;s , well that &apos;s NP VP .
and what NP VP and S CC S , what do you know , what what do you want VP ?
RB , UH , PP PP , PRP VBP NP .
NP VP , but S , CC S .
or what PRP MD ADVP VP , so some cool machines , extremely expensive ones , extremely dist@@ ant ones , for professional staf@@ f , trained acade@@ mi@@ cs with DT NN &apos;s NN FW only .
and PRP$ NN VBD S .
that &apos;s not necessary IN NP , because NP ADVP VP .
and so with this pre@@ mis@@ es with this pre@@ mis@@ es , brian de@@ g@@ ger in england , for example , tried to set RP DT NN , took a pressure coo@@ ker , a hot pla@@ te and , yes , sou@@ p stock , and b@@ red bacteria with PRP , VBG PP .
so NN WHNP S , has RB VBN NP .
i then tried to exp@@ and DT IN NP RB RB , and so i bought some secon@@ d@@ hand equipment on e@@ bay and did a little dna analysis , and tried to VB NP ADVP .
that &apos;s not supposed to be a jo@@ ke , but here in the image below S , NP . i &apos;d like to brie@@ fly mention a project .
that here is JJ , NP SBAR , basically NP PP IN PP .
and yes , so you can see that it &apos;s DT ADJP NN , RB IN NP .
but RB ADVP IN NP .
the first project that we did IN NP , WRB NP VP , you might VB , okay we exist IN NP , and we &apos;re RB , and we we know the people who VBP ADVP VP and everything .
and NP PP PP VBD CC VBD : S
we really need TO VP , and he organis@@ ed CD NNS , NP PP , IN NP , and shor@@ tly IN NP , in FW FW .
and , the focus there was on , so okay , WHNP S , WHNP S , WHNP SQ ?
and WHNP S and WHNP S ?
and RB PRP VBD PP .
NP VP , NP VP , NP VP .
RB , IN NP , DT ADJP NN VBD VP .
and that was then PRP VBZ RB ADJP , but PRP VBZ S .
and then we even tried VP , but somehow PRP NP RB VBN ADVP .
so i think S .
UH , WHNP PP VBP NP VP ?
a project NP VP , was CD WHPP S .
this is when you focus a las@@ er be@@ am on NP PP , and then you can catch little particles in NP PP or in IN NP and then move them in this focus , so , they &apos;re then tra@@ pped in there , so it &apos;s basically like a tra@@ ctor be@@ am .
that really works , it &apos;s done in an acade@@ mic setting , and then we thought , okay , we might manage that , and took a web@@ c@@ am , dis@@ man@@ t@@ led it , took off the l@@ ens , turned it around and then we have a microscop@@ e , which has DT QP NN RB .
PRP MD VP .
and then we VP CC VP NP and RB VBD S .
and RB DT NN JJ NN NN , but PRP VBD NP PP .
DT NN , S , VBD VP , and DT VBZ ADJP .
he took CD IN NP well , CD IN NP , so he was working IN NP , his his ni@@ ck@@ name is sam neuro@@ ha@@ ck .
NP ADVP VP , and NP VP .
NNS MD VP .
their brain waves were RB VBN , and depen@@ ding IN SBAR , JJ NNS IN NP swi@@ t@@ ched IN .
VBD NP .
another thing from NP SBAR , is the NP , NP , DT ADJP NN .
this is IN NP , IN IN S .
so when i now that NNS WHNP S , and then they can say , okay , this hair bel@@ on@@ gs to this person , like that .
and the machines WDT VP , the ones NP VP , they start at QP NNS at DT JJS .
and DT VBZ PP , but PRP VBZ NP .
RB that NP SBAR .
and they have there were two two tin@@ ker@@ ers who VBD PP PP and VBD , S , and VBN ADVP NP and they &apos;re now the they &apos;ve now managed VP and are currently the the che@@ ap@@ est provi@@ ders of these devices worldwide .
PRP VBP SBAR .
PRP VBZ S , but PRP VBZ ADVP PP .
RB DT VBD NP .
NP SBAR VBD NP .
a gene gun is , UH , NP PP .
you charge JJ NNS IN NP and then put DT NN NNS IN NP , and then i shot IN NP and VBD S and NP PP .
RB NP PRP VBP ADVP NP .
but that &apos;s my PRP$ NN , WDT VP and that was but DT NN VBD ADJP , and the thing broke .
RB PRP VP CC VP .
NP , SBAR , PRP VBZ NP , i think IN NP .
and PP NP VP and ADVP NP VP .
and DT JJ NN IN NP starts IN NP , IN S .
ADVP NP VP , but NP VP .
so that NP RRC , VP CC VP involved .
because as i said IN NP , it &apos;s an RB JJ technology and most people know RB JJ PP and RB have NP PP .
because if PRP RB VBD PP PP , that &apos;s NP IN SBAR or have VBN NP S .
and PRP VBP SBAR .
and if , as an in@@ formed citi@@ zen , you wish VP , you need access to DT NN and DT NN .
and CC NP VP .
and DT VBZ PP NP .
RB PP PRP VBP VP .
and DT VBZ SBAR .
DT VBP NP .
RB NP PP RB .
and PRP VBZ ADVP ADJP SBAR .
DT VBZ SBAR .
PRP VBP PP .
and PRP VBP ADVP NP .
NP PP VBP ADVP VP .
and DT VBZ NP .
UH PRP VBD , S .
and NP , RRC VBD NP , PP .
and that &apos;s become NP , INTJ , NP .
and of course we hope that NP VP .
and NP VP and NP VP .
it &apos;s not DT JJ , but PRP VBZ ADVP RB ADJP , and IN S , PRP MD VP .
NNS IN S .
DT VBD NP .
UH , UH .
WRB VBP NP VP ?
this is a question WDT ADVP VP .
there , the focus is on WHADVP S , so that NP VP .
i think that NP NP VP CC VP .
and this is really incredible , because people actually believe IN S .
RB WP VBP NP ?
PRP VP CC VP .
JJ NNS VBP NP .
ADJP NNS VBZ NP SBAR .
DT MD VP .
i will VB NP PP , ADVP , and will VB S .
and the second aspe@@ ct is that IN S , PRP VBP ADVP ADJP , SBAR .
and DT JJ NN VBZ PP ADVP .
we all know that NP VP .
DT JJ NN VBZ SBAR .
but WRB VBZ NP PP , SBAR ?
PRP MD VP .
WHADJP NNS VBZ NP VP ?
we PRP VBP S , but DT VBG VP CC VP .
in PRP$ NN , you are VBG PP SBAR .
DT VBZ SBAR .
PRP VBP VP .
JJ , NN NP NP ?
at the media cam@@ pus , for NN , we are VBG S , but we have RB RB VBN ADJP PP .
and this this ability VP was NP SBAR , IN S .
PRP VBP SBAR .
and PRP VBP SBAR .
PRP VBP SBAR .
NP SBAR VBD NP .
and IN NP PRP VBD NP .
IN NP NN VBD VP , and IN NP , NN VBD VP .
and DT VBZ SBAR .
NP PP VBZ SBAR .
UH , DT VBZ ADJP .
NP PP VBZ SBAR .
RB VB S .
WP VBZ NP ?
PRP MD VP .
but PRP VBP VP .
NP PP VBZ ADVP VP .
NP , NP , NP , VBD ADVP VP .
and NN PRP VBP ADVP ADJP PP .
according to NP PP , we still spend QP NP IN NP .
DT VBZ SBAR , it has VBN NP S .
now we think IN S .
UH , UH , DT VBZ NP ADVP .
DT VBZ ADVP ADVP , PP .
what VBZ ADJP is the fact that NP VP .
PRP VBD PRT NP .
PRP VBP VP .
and as you can VB , this is an area WHNP S and IN S .
and PRP VBD NP S .
perhaps you &apos;ve VBN PP ADVP , SBAR .
PRP VBP NP .
they don S
and DT JJ NN IN NP is IN S .
and IN NP NN VBD NP .
DT VBZ SBAR .
and these sounds and this rhyth@@ m de@@ pic@@ ted the ge@@ ology and to@@ po@@ graph@@ y of DT NN and DT of NN RB VBD S and could also return to the starting point .
WRB VBP NP ADVP VP ?
IN JJS RB S .
WP WHNP S ?
WHNP S VBZ NP .
IN NP , PRP VBD PP .
ADVP NP VP and ADVP NP VP .
and WP VP is IN S .
IN NP and IN NP .
NP PP VBZ SBAR .
virtu@@ ality has RB VBN S
and VBZ NP S .
bru@@_ce brown , a famous design resear@@_cher at bri@@_gh@@_ton university , went so far as to say that mass media and he means books and images , not tv , the internet et@@_c. which is what we would define as mass media today that these mass media have turned our memor@@_ies to stone and have ero@@_ded our ability to virtu@@_al@@_ise .
VB S .
IN NP IN NP .
WP VP ?
DT VBP NP .
and they will NP VP .
that means that PP , NP VP .
PRP RB RBR VB .
PRP VBP NP .
PRP RB RBR VP , CC VP .
PRP VBP SBAR .
and NP VP and NP VP .
WHNP S VBZ NP .
PRP VBP ADVP VP .
NP VP , WP VP ?
PRP VBD NP , PRP VBP VP and PRP VBP ADVP VP .
NP VP and PP , NP VP .
but NP PP , PRP VBP VP .
DT VBZ UCP .
PRP VBP SBAR .
EX VBP NP .
so if you think of the google glas@@ ses for example , then that &apos;s one of those concep@@ ts WDT VP , and so that means our aff@@ in@@ ity for NN , of VP , is being VBN ADVP .
another example is RB HYPH VBN virtual reality as JJ as NP VP , we are physi@@ cally moving IN NP RB , according to DT NN IN NP .
and JJ DT NN VBP NP .
DT VBP NP .
DT WHNP S .
to finish , i brought along , and i hope DT NN VP , NP .
NP VP VBP ADVP NP-TMP .
RB PRP MD ADVP ADVP VP , so NNS MD VP .
i brought NP CONJP NP VP .
NP VP , PRP MD VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
and when i say JJ NML NN , you probably are imag@@ ining DT NN IN NP .
IN NP , PRP VBP S .
DT VBZ NP .
and PRP VBD ADVP VP .
and this game conne@@ cts DT JJ NN , IN S , IN NP .
PRP VBP ADJP .
PRP MD VP .
DT NN IN NP is IN S .
and so i can have a very different view of DT NN , DT ADJP NN , because i VBP NP and , IN NP , VBP NP .
PRP MD VP .
ah , WP NP VP , sorry , is NP PP .
ADVP SBAR , DT VBZ ADJP .
VP , PRP MD VP .
right , i &apos;d like to sum@@ mar@@ ise my my pres@@ entation by stat@@ ing IN S , IN S and IN IN S .
VBP NP .
UH , PRP VBP ADJP .
PRP VP CC VP .
PRP VBD NP .
PRP VBP VP .
but IN ADVP PRP VBP RB VP .
UH , NNS VP CC VP , CC ADVP VP .
i &apos;m a designer from birth , so of course i deal with NP CC SBAR and need TO VP .
DT VBZ NP .
WHADVP S , PRP VBP ADVP VP .
and DT VBZ SBAR .
DT NN NN IN NP .
now you &apos;ll be VBG NP SBAR .
and now i &apos;ll hold up one of these little devices , because NNS VBP VP , and RB PRP VBP S .
and against that background , within the area of natural user interface design , so NP PP VBP PP , i looked into how our tools , or how the computer has suc@@ c@@ essi@@ vely trans@@ formed PRP IN NP IN NP .
RB PRP VBD PP .
RB PRP MD VP .
WRB VBZ NP VP ?
so if PRP VBP PP , we are moving IN NP .
from DT ADJP NN .
DT NN VBZ VP .
IN NP EX VBD NP .
that means people related IN NP IN S and basically created DT JJ NN .
but DT JJ NN VBD ADJP .
PRP VBD NP , but PRP VBP NP ADVP .
DT VBD ADVP VP .
that was a massive out@@ c@@ ry at the time , because of NN it was WHADVP S .
depen@@ ding on WHADVP S , a RB JJ kind of NN comes into VP , so TO VP .
but RB DT VBN NN VP , CC VP .
RB DT JJ NN VBD , SBAR .
DT VBZ NP PP .
that was also an aff@@ r@@ on@@ t at the time , where the gent@@ ry , c@@ ler@@ gy@@ men and others said : VBP NP VP , if the people start TO VP , they &apos;ll want VP and that would be totally f@@ at@@ al of NN .
and now we &apos;re going into DT JJ NN and DT JJ NN about NP VP and ADVP NP VP .
of course it RB conf@@ uses PRP , IN S .
with its complete transpar@@ ency , which is NP PP say that there &apos;s now NN NN IN NP and not bee@@ f or other phenomen@@ a , because i want TO VP .
and DT CD NNS , NP PP , are VBG PP PP .
the exciting thing about this is that WRB NP VP , you can VB SBAR .
but RB PRP VBZ PP .
PRP VBP VP .
that NP VP .
not , if NP VP and NP VP , the whole thing will no longer work .
that means NP VP .
just like when NNS IN NP used VP , RB it &apos;s happening IN NP IN NP .
PRP VBP S and PRP VBP S .
just like NP VP .
against that background i looked WHPP S , WP VBZ ADJP , WHNP SQ , and WHNP SQ , so WDT NN VBZ NP VP ?
because NP ADVP VP , can VB NP ?
so you have TO VP .
and to see WRB NP VP and WRB NP , PP , VP the things are fun and easy to use .
ADVP SBAR , PRP VBP PP .
CC RB course WDT VP .
and WRB VBZ NP VP ?
and WRB VBP NP VP ?
and SBARQ CC SBARQ
UH NNP NNS RB VBD : S .
so you really have VP , IN S , and what does DT VB ADVP .
and there you see that , that NNS DT PRP$ CD NNS , most people think NP ADVP VP , but S , CC S .
and VP ?
CC ADVP ?
NN VBZ NP .
JJ NNS VP CC VP .
but i have to have a fundamental understanding , to ADVP VP .
CC ADVP .
we can see that here , when i design things , then i can design them in a conf@@ using way , as you can VB ADVP PP , or i can basically design them intui@@ tively , by showing NNS .
so a lot more naturally , and though NP VP , i can RB VB SBAR .
and if PRP VBP PP , S , they &apos;d VP .
with DT NN they &apos;d just ADVP VP , SBAR VP .
but NP , SBAR .
for NP PP .
the right circle looks JJR IN NP , even though NP VP , they &apos;re RB RB JJ , and yet our perception changes , depen@@ ding on DT NN we place things in .
does NN VB SBAR ?
VB PRT .
NN NN MD ADVP VP .
RB RB PRP VBZ ADJP .
RB PRP VBZ NP .
DT JJ NN VBZ VP .
and if i then place a half o@@ val next IN NP , we suddenly no longer just see a unit , WDT VP and , yes , we see a unit , and no longer three parts , one circle , one circle , another .
DT VBZ VP .
IN NP PRP VBZ ADJP , they usually have PRP IN NP .
NP PP , NP PP .
PRP VBP ADVP VP .
but PRP VBZ NP , SBAR .
NP SBAR VBZ NP .
DT MD VP , but PRP VBZ ADJP , SBAR .
ADVP NP VP and ADVP NP VP .
DT VBZ ADJP .
RB PRP VBP PP PP .
because NP VP you re@@ co@@ g@@ n@@ ise IN NP .
that means PRP NP SBAR , ADVP NP VP , and RB NP VP , okay ,
NP VP , PRP VBD NP .
and DT VBZ SBAR .
then it goes RB IN NP , IN NP and says , now take DT NN and make JJ IN S .
and RB PRP VBZ ADVP PP and PRP VBZ SBAR .
so it &apos;s NP , SBAR and NP PP .
PRP VBP SBAR .
NP SBAR VBZ ADVP VP .
NN VBZ ADVP VP .
PRP VBP SBAR .
does NN VB NP S ?
DT NN , RB .
RB PRP VBP VP .
PRP VBP ADVP VP .
RB PRP VBP NP .
and , WHNP S , NP ADVP RB RB VB NP .
that means NP VP , and i &apos;ve condi@@ tioned PRP , IN NP , VP .
and DT VBZ NP .
RB PRP VP CC VP .
RB PRP VBP NP .
so these are ADJP NNS , WHNP S .
does NN VB SBAR ?
DT JJ NN , UH .
DT VBZ NP .
RB PRP VBZ ADVP ADJP S .
if i know NP VP , then i am well capable of VBG VBG NNS , IN SBAR .
PRP MD VP .
then it will turn IN NP and , in that way , i can bridge VP , if i know DT NN .
WP VP ?
UH , NNS .
another RB JJ phenomenon .
PRP VBZ NP .
that means , attention , now you know IN , PRN , SBAR .
and NP , RRC .
DT VBZ NP .
DT VBZ SBAR .
and the way NP VP we gu@@ ard ourselves against PRP$ NN so TO VP .
of NN designers don JJ NN RB VBP PP .
RB WRB VBP NP VP .
on DT CD NN there are NP PP .
EX VBP NP , SBAR .
but there are also symbo@@ lic fun@@ ctions ; WRB VBZ NP VP that PRP MD ADVP VP , even when PRP VBZ RB ADJP ?
we &apos;re RBR IN NP , IN NP , NN SBAR .
VBG NP is NP PP .
us@@ ability always means how can PRP VB NP ADVP or WRB MD NP VP .
DT VBZ SBAR .
WRB MD NP VP ?
can PRP VP CC VP .
and RB PRP VBZ ADJP .
VP VB S .
DT VBZ NP .
and if you look at some of NP PP , then you &apos;ll understand WHADVP S a lot more intui@@ tive than classi@@ cal software .
intui@@ tive us@@ ability didn &apos; t start to VB NP us@@ able for NNS .
WRB ?
because , as a rule , we can reach PRP$ NN ADVP IN NP .
you need to imagine IN S .
that probably JJ JJ NN VB SBAR you can do IN NP .
but what PRP VBP S is that PP NP VP , TO VP .
if we go RB IN NP , here you see NP VP , WDT VP , and it took months TO VP .
then came the next ones , which already worked IN NP , IN S .
RB RB NP PP .
DT VBD NP , but IN NP PRP MD ADVP VP .
NP PP VP ADVP VP .
RB , IN NP , PRP VBP NP ADVP .
DT NNS RB DT NN NN .
IN S ADVP IN S , and NN VBZ VP .
and if i go NP RBR in DT JJ NN inter@@ faces , where PRP MD VP , then i am even RBR CC RBR immedi@@ ate .
but DT RB VBZ NP PP PP ?
if PRP VBP ADJP and RB PRP VBP S , when is something really intui@@ tive ?
and DT NNS IN NP is JJ WHADVP S .
RB RB NNS VBP NP SBAR , they want VP .
ADVP SBAR , DT RBR JJ PRP VBZ .
and WP VBZ NP VP ?
it means that WHADVP S , RB PRP MD VP .
that VBZ SBAR and MD ADVP VP .
that pos@@ es DT NN IN IN SBAR and now i &apos;ve RB VBN NP ADVP .
PRP VBZ NP .
PRP DT VBP NP , and NN VBZ NP .
DT CD IN NP is VBG NP NP-TMP , but you &apos;re VP .
the model already takes shape while you &apos;re RB IN NP and it &apos;s inter@@ cultural , so it VBZ ADVP PP , and VBZ VP .
NN IN NP is VBN PP NP-TMP PP , it was as@@ certain@@ ed IN S .
PRP MD VP .
and this kind of NN , ADVP , CC ADVP DT NN IN NP , but DT NN IN NP , a principle of NN .
and that &apos;s IN NP IN NP .
and if i now trans@@ fer this , if i let VB S , and i can look at in NN , and yes , trans@@ act means i can put it somewhere or send someone or do the sh@@ opp@@ ing , etc . ,
and RB PRP MD VP .
PRP VBP VP .
NN VBD VP .
NN : NP VP .
PRP VP , VP CC VP , RB show PRP PDT DT NNS IN NP , for NN .
and RB PRP VBP NP .
because the fact that i can VB NP PP , SBAR , is consi@@ der@@ ably more natural than WRB NP VP so to speak .
imagination is more important than NN , and i &apos;d like TO VP .
PRP VBP SBAR .
fir@@ stly , when you are growing up as DT NN , as NP , NP is which what sort of ex@@ cre@@ tions you have , right ? and depen@@ ding on whether your parents have allowed you TO ADVP VP , your curi@@ osity is of course a@@ wa@@ ken@@ ed .
and NN MD VP .
that &apos;s WHADVP S .
my obje@@ ctive is VP .
and RB VBZ CD JJ NN RB .
and DT VBZ S .
VB VP .
every day you rele@@ ase SYM S PRP VBP S .
RB PRP JJ JJ NN VBP NP .
and PRP VBP S .
PRP VBP S .
PRP VBP RB VP .
IN , PP , S VB CC VB NP .
incredibly enough , we we are VBG PP ADVP SBAR .
because S , CC S .
DT NN NN VBZ ADJP .
PRP VBP ADJP .
we only have NP PP and phosp@@ hor@@ us min@@ ing worldwide is RB VBG NP PP .
IN NP RB , NP PP VBD VP .
and PRP VBP NP .
PRP VBZ NP .
and PRP VBP S .
RB , IN NP , VP , VP .
VP , VBP NP .
VP , VBP NP .
but DT VBZ RB NP .
NP VP , VBD NP NP PP .
PRP VBZ NP .
if NP VP , then our our entire planet will VB NP ADVP .
DT VBZ SBAR .
and NP VP VBZ NP .
DT NN NNS IN NP .
at the moment we &apos;re VP CC VP , if NP VP .
DT VBZ SBAR .
RB RB PRP MD VP .
and NN VBZ NP .
IN NP , IN NP , NP PP VBZ PP .
and IN S , DT NNS VBP ADJP .
SYM WHNP S .
right ?
PRP DT NN VBZ PP .
NP VP , but WHNP S .
NN MD VP .
PRP VBZ ADJP .
RB DT NN VBZ , SBARQ ?
RB PRP VBP NP , PP .
PRP VBP SBAR .
IN PP , NN VBZ VP .
IN NP , PRP VBZ VP .
yes .
RB NNS MD VP .
NP VP , NP NP ?
tradition@@ ally , in NP PP , there is DT NN IN S .
and if you den@@ y NNS DT S , people become grab@@ by and ho@@ sti@@ le .
and so you have someone like NP VP .
IN S , IN S , PRP VBP S .
IN NP PRP VBP , NP .
yes .
DT JJ NN VBZ , SQ ?
if NP VP , then ants wei@@ gh NP CONJP NP .
NP VP , but PP VP NP .
RB NNS VBP NP SBAR .
and because they work RB RB JJR ADVP IN S their energy consumption amo@@ unts to DT IN NP .
NP VP , NP VP , NP VP ?
and when you see how far VBN SBAR , you can understand why NN , IN NP , has DT NN S , right ?
NP VP , PRP VBP ?
DT VBZ NP .
have PRP RB VBN NP ?
VBP NP ?
RB CD JJ NN ?
NP VP , PRP VBP ?
PRP VB ?
RB is not NP SBAR JJ .
RB , JJ ?
RB NP NP IN NP .
EX VBP ADVP NP .
IN NP have PRP RB VBN PP ?
RB NP PP VBZ PP .
and then you see that NP VP .
DT NN PRP VBP NP .
and RB RB VBP ADJP .
RB because IN NP .
that means we feel RB JJ PP , SBAR CC SBAR .
NP SBAR JJ ?
and DT VBZ SBAR .
PRP RB VBZ NP S .
but WRB VBP NP PP ?
PRP VBP S , but DT NN VBZ S .
we want to VB ADJP , SBAR , right ?
CD NNS , NP VP ?
PRP MD ADVP VP .
RB IN S , PRP VBP ADVP VP .
RB PRP MD VP .
PRP MD VP .
PRP MD VP .
IN NP PRP VBP PP .
DT VBZ NP .
PRP VBP NP PP , SBAR .
PP NP VP , PRP MD VP ?
and IN NP PRP VBD ADVP ADJP .
this means that NP VP .
so the cities had VP and the cities had VP .
DT VBZ SBAR and RB PRP VBD .
PRP VB ?
PRP VBD ADJP .
they managed VP .
even today , if PRP VBP VP , people expect PRP TO VP .
because NP VP .
PRP VBD SBAR .
DT VBZ SBAR .
the nice thing about that is that when you do that , so when you VBP NP , VBP NP , IN NP , a farmer can ear@@ n about QP NNS and main@@ tain the p@@ lot with PRP , raise chi@@ ck@@ ens and pig@@ s and du@@ cks and grow NNS and NN NN .
and DT JJ NN IN NP is IN S .
so we don S .
PRP MD VP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
DT NN NN VBZ NP .
and PRP VBP VP .
DT VBZ SBAR .
and none of DT NNS , and PRP VBP VP , none of DT NNS was every s@@ ab@@ ot@@ a@@ ged .
PRP MD VP and DT NN MD VP .

that means S .
PRP MD VP .

and by the way , if PRP VBP S the most su@@ it@@ able pu@@ ri@@ fication plant is DT CD IN NP .

everybody who has anything VP knows that a transl@@ ator can VB NP ADVP ADVP VB NP PP , but must also understand DT JJR NN IN NP and DT NN WHPP S , so that DT JJ NN MD VP .
transl@@ ating from JJ into NNP can already demand JJR NN , ADVP IN S SBAR IN S CC RB poetry .
WHNP S VBZ ADJP .
IN NP PRP RB VBP NP PP .
now you probably think IN S .
IN NP DT NNS VBP ADJP .
these notes are ADJP PP , RB IN S .
because you can VB SBAR , you can VB S , you can &apos; NN VP CC VP .
this means that NP VP .
NN PRP VBP SBAR .
RB PRP MD VP .
that &apos;s why PRP VBP S .
DT ADJP , NN VBZ NP .
DT JJ NNS VBP NP .
so it &apos;s not enough VP .
DT MD ADVP VP .
PRP VBP SBAR .
so you need RB RBS ADJP NN VP .
there are different gra@@ des here , for example if you are RB VBG NP PP PP , SBAR , PP .
NP PP VBZ PRT ADVP .
once you &apos;ve VBN NP S , SBAR .
PRP VBP NP PP .
PRP VBP NP , SBAR .
PRP VBP NP .
PRP VBP NP .
DT NNS IN S .
ADVP CC NP VBD NP VP ?
WHNP S , WRB VBD NP ?
WHNP NP NP .
PRP VBP NP PP .
after a while , you already have DT JJ NN IN NP , and you listen to PRP regul@@ arly , and so it becomes easier and easier to VB CC VB PP .
DT NN RB VBZ PP .
PRP$ NN S VBZ NP S .
as the note VBZ NP , and VBZ , rather , a frame@@ work , i will now u@@ tili@@ se this frame@@ work TO VP .
RB PRP MD VP .

what PRP VBP PP ADVP , SBAR .
every note , every phr@@ ase is th@@ us given DT NN , IN S .

it always makes for DT JJ NN WHADVP S , even IN S .
it &apos;s like VP , i experience the same piece an@@ e@@ w again and again .
i &apos;m a day older , the seas@@ ons change , my pul@@ se is slo@@ wer in DT NN than PRP VBZ PP , in a conc@@ ert hall it takes longer for DT NN to VB SBAR .

when PRP RB VBP NP PP and PP NP VP , RB NP VP , which , together , sound like NN .

sure NP VP , yes , but what do PRP VB SBAR sing ?
then i ask PRP DT , MD NP RB VP ?
or NP , SBAR ?
in both cases , it &apos;s not too late to VB , to VB PRT SBAR , or to VB SBAR .
because NP VP .

RB S , WHADJP VBD NP ?
did PRP VB NP , SBAR ?

because NP VP , i don S .

whether NP VP .

with time , you will VB NP and will VB S or will RB VB ADJP .

when a child gro@@ ws RP IN NP WHADVP S what color is your flo@@ wer ?
can PRP VB NP PP ADVP ?

RB VBD NP NP-TMP .
PRP RB VBP NP .
i think S .
i can VB S .
IN NP PRP VBP SBAR .

DT VBZ SBAR .
so that SBAR VP .

do PRP VB SBAR ?
were PRP RB JJ ?

terrible .
PRP VBP NP .
WHADVP S , PRP VBP NP .

PRP MD VP .

WRB VBP NP VP ?
and RB PRP VBZ PP ADVP .
PRP VBZ PP .
and WHADVP S , DT NN VBZ .
PRP$ NN VBZ VP .
PRP MD ADVP VP .
i would like VP , IN S .

but VBP NP PRP MD VP , NN VBZ NP .

DT NNP NML NN RB VBD NP .
DT NN RB VBD SBAR .
NN NNS VBP , ADVP VP .
PRP MD VP .
at this point and if PRP VBP S , you &apos;ll recognize WHADJP S and WHNP S .
because NP VP .
the artist tells PRP NP , CC RB NP , IN S .
the artist is VBG NP .
then DT JJ NN IN S .
here you have NP , SBAR .
and this turns RP CONJP PP , CONJP PP IN PP , IN NP .
perhaps you know DT NN IN NP ?
CD NN DT NN VBZ , S .
over NP CC NP .
and you also know WRB JJ NP VP .
but we should RB VB SBAR .
PRP VBZ ADJP .
we need DT NN RB , VP .
PRP VBP SBAR .
and RB RB VBZ NP PP .
PRP VBD PP PP .
that NP VP and that , yes , there is QP NN VBN PP .
ADVP NP VP , ADVP SBAR VP .
that S CC S .
UH , UH , DT VBZ RB ADJP .
and IN S , PRP MD VP .
WRB VBP NP VP ?
IN S VB NP PP .
because we want NP , NP , VBD PP , ADVP , PP PP PP , that &apos;s unbe@@ ar@@ able for us .
RB PRP MD VP .
PRP VBP S .
to VB NP SBAR and to VB NP , i would like TO VP .
DT ADJP NN , IN NP .
PRP$ NN VBD NP NP .
CD NN PRP VBD ADVP PP , PRP VBZ NP , and PRP VBD NP PP .
an JJ pu@@ pi@@ l .
PRP VBZ S , SBAR .
CC NP VP , so WHNP SQ ?
and RB PRP VBD , S .
and IN S , PRP VBP ADJP .
UH , PRP VBP S SBAR , something is not RB JJ .
i told my wife , WRB NP VP .
PRP VBP NP and RB PRP VBP VP , IN S , PRP VBP ADJP .
PRP VBP SBAR .
NP PP , PRP VBZ RB VP .
PRP VBZ ADJP .
but EX VBP NP .
ADVP NP NP , SBAR .
DT NNS WHADVP S .
and mor@@ e@@ over , you don NP VP WHADVP S .
no , it simply looks DT NN JJR WHADVP S .
RB PRP VBP NP .
this this hin@@ t at NP SBAR say that out l@@ oud .
here you have the VB PP anything about it , and which shapes things you know look very different in PDT DT NN that PRP MD VP .
in DT NN certain words come IN S .
PRP VBP SBAR .
but PRP VBP SBAR .
PRP MD VP .
PRP VBZ ADJP .
PRP VBP ADVP SBAR .
according to WDT NP VP , this self - deception , this will@@ ing@@ ness TO VP is val@@ id in PRP$ ADJP NNS ?
PRP MD VP .
the first example works IN NP , and RB ADJP IN NP don JJ NN NN IN RB .
PRP VBP S .
WP VBZ NP ?
NP VP , NN VBD .
PRP VBZ RB VP .
and when you are with people who are fir@@ m@@ ly convinced that S , CC , S , S , CC S , CC S , bo@@ und to the earth , ep@@ he@@ mer@@ al , subject to deca@@ y , in@@ significant , dead really .
and now PRP VBP NP PP it &apos;s called NN IN ADJP , VP .
and when NP PP VBZ PRT PP , the human is filled IN NP , IN NP , IN NP .
and RB PRP MD VP .
DT VBZ SBAR .
that NP VP .
PRP VBP VP .
and if PRP VBP PP S we feel WRB NP VP .
IN ADVP PRP MD VP .
PRP VBP VP .
DT VBZ NP .
DT , IN NP , VBZ NP .
PRP VBP SBAR .
RB TO VP .
NP PP VBZ NP .
DT JJ NN VBZ , SBAR .
NP VP , SBAR , ADVP NP VP .
RB PRP VBP NP .
PRP VBD NP ADVP .
a third theor@@ em WDT VP .
NP VP , NP VP .
RB PRP VBP NP ADVP .
RB DT NN VBZ VP .
PRP VBP NP ADVP .
DT JJ CD NNS VBP ADVP ADJP .
PRP MD VP .
NN VBZ RB VP .
NP VP , DT JJ NN VBZ NP .
and IN S , RB DT NN VBZ NP .
IN S , RB DT NN VBZ RB NP .

WHNP S , IN S , RB PRP VBZ ADJP .
RB WHADVP S , EX VBZ NP .
RB , IN S , RB PRP VBD SBAR .
DT NNS VBP ADVP ADJP .
and RB PRP$ JJ NN ADVP NP , PRP MD VP .
so it atta@@ ches a third theor@@ em to NP , SBAR and only acts as if NP VP .
because NP VP .
but with this lo@@ gic , WDT ADVP VP , we can save our lie .
RB PRP VBP SBAR .
and PRP VBP ADJP .
PRP MD VP .
PP IN PRP VBP NP .
RB PRP VBP S .
that has VP
century .
ADVP VBD NP VP , and NP VP .
NP NP VBZ NP .
PRP VBD SBAR .
PRP VBZ NP .
and IN S , PRP MD VP .
IN S PRP MD VP .
RB PRP VBZ ADVP .
DT VBZ SBAR .
NP PP MD VP .
NN MD VP .
only if NP VP , so as soon as NP VP , then he doesn NP VP .
PRP VBD ADVP VP .
if you imagine S , you will also quickly have the feeling that NP VP .
and as NP VP , i &apos;ll VB NP PP .
there &apos;s S , CC S , there is no free will .
RB PRP MD VP : IN S , RB PRP VBZ NP .
DT NNS VBP ADJP .
and now DT NN S is WHNP S .
it looks NN IN NP and is RB IN NP .
RB PRP VBP NP ADVP .
really , you &apos;d S .
but the lo@@ gic of NN allows PRP TO VP .
and now you can simply , if S CC S .
VP , EX VBP NP .
and VP VBP NP PP .
PRP VBP SBAR .
UH , EX VBP NP .
you &apos;ll RB VB NP PP , you can &apos; NP VP .
and PRP VBP SBAR .
because while NP VP , your counter@@ part will VB ADJP .
PRP VBD VP .
because NP VP .
because NP VP .
PRP VBZ ADJP .
so IN NP you are VBG NP .
and if you have another opportunity VP , do it , because you will VB S .
VBP NP PP .
UH , UH .
PRP VBD NP .
she VBZ NP and VBD NP S .
NP VP , and NP VP , i found NP ADJP .
and PRP VBD SBAR .
but RB RB PRP VBZ NP .
i probably bel@@ ong , are those two friend@@ ly girls ADVP , NP ADVP VP , i think it &apos;s called NN NN .
and then i went IN NP IN S .
RB VBD NP .
NP VP , NP PP VBD ADVP VP .
NN PRP VBP VP .
because NP VP .
but NN JJ PP , WDT VP , that was a to@@ y .
and IN NP EX VBD ADJP .
i &apos;m gr@@ ate@@ ful to NP PP that PRP VBD SBAR .
but PRP VBD NP PP .
at DT NN , EX VBD NP and NP PP VBD PP PP , SBAR .
a terror@@ ist place , but it was S CC S .
and yes , DT NN IN WHNP VBZ VP really moves me , because NP VP .
NP VP , PRP VBD VP .
PRP VBD NP .
if one person said no , there was DT NN NN , WHNP S , i PRP VBD NP PP had told PRP , you wa@@ sted your money on your child .
PRP VBZ S .
and that was really very , very bit@@ ter and then you end up in one of these ph@@ ases just now you saw that image with don &apos; t give RP written on it , where i asked myself after ten years , whether the CD CD deutsch@@ mark it was at DT NN , NP , NP , whether DT VBD ADVP PP .
and then i stuck to it until n@@ ine@@ te@@ en nin@@ et@@ y six and then i became NP PP VBD ADVP PP .
a huge success story , but there too we have the problem of a growing company and then in two thousand and six , we , a small group , decided that we would start JJ RB and go RB and would de@@ dic@@ ate ourselves to the next top@@ ic of NP , NP , in my opini@@ on , and in our opini@@ on , and it &apos;s crazy again , it starts with people saying , what &apos;s this non@@ sense about , that won &apos; t work . i &apos;m talking about stor@@ age .
PRP VBP VP .
NP PP VBD , SBAR .
and PRP VBD S .
IN NP , DT VBZ NP .
UH , RB VBZ NP .
NP CC NP VBP ADVP .
PRP VBP NP .
the question is , WHADVP SQ
IN ADVP PRP VBZ ADVP RB ADJP .
IN S , DT NN MD VP .
DT VBZ SBAR .
PRP ADVP ADVP VP ?
PRP VBP NP .
DT MD VP .
but that &apos;s not JJ , we have NP PP and our network is , SBAR , DT NNP CD .
if NP VP , we &apos;d RB VB NP .
the question is RB , VP , ADVP ADVP VP .
how big would a battery like NP ADVP VP .
and UH , PRP VBP NP PP .
DT JJ NN VBZ PP .
IN NP , IN NP JJ NN IN NP is VBN PP .
DT NNS JJ PP .
the world &apos;s S .
PRP VBZ ADVP .
PRP VBP NP PP .
and DT RB VBZ PP .
IN NP , S , CD VBP ADVP VP .
UH , DT VBZ SBAR .
PRP VBD VP .
and DT NN NN NN or DT JJ NN NN or WP NP VP is generally a ADVP system , or DT NN WHNP S .
PRP$ NN VBD S , UH ,
the dies@@ el will VB NP , the sun will serve DT NN IN NP IN S .
and IN S , PRP VBP S .
that means IN S .
RB RB PRP MD ADVP VP .
NP PP VBZ VP .
PRP VBZ PP , so PRP MD VP .
NNS RB VBP NP , SBARQ ?
DT VBZ ADJP .
but if S CC S , it becomes RB JJ .
and our a@@ im was , we wanted to reach ADJP NNS and then this re@@ main@@ der is still here , the last re@@ main@@ der , the last ten , tw@@ ent@@ y percent rene@@ w@@ able energi@@ es with , that will will be very , very expensive and gener@@ ating this from bat@@ ter@@ ies won &apos; t work either .
that will RB VB NP , that &apos;s WP NP VP .
you will RB RB VB S .
PRP RB VBD S .
WRB RB MD NP VP ?
and RB PRP VBD PRT NP .
and we simul@@ ated wind and sun and the load , and the result , a very exciting result , was that compared IN NP , you &apos;d S .
DT VBD NP PP .
and RB PRP VBD , INTJ ,
NP VP , ADVP NP VP .
PRP VBP S .
and RB PRP VBD S .
WP VP ?
NP VP , PRP VBD PP .
NP VP , DT MD SBAR .
and RB PRP VBP NP ADVP .
NP VP , DT JJ NN VBZ NP .
the fact that PRP$ NN VBZ NP is due to DT NN that PRP RB VBP NP PP .
and the power u@@ tili@@ ty , WDT SBAR , said S .
PRP VBD , SBAR , but PRP VBP SBAR .
and that &apos;s why PRP VBD S .
DT VBZ SBAR .
RB PRP VBZ .
RB PRP VBZ PP , PP .
and fun@@ ni@@ ly enough it was VBN PP , VBN NP-TMP , PP , and VBD ADVP VP .
PRP VBZ SBAR .
it VBZ NP and MD VP and it &apos;s NP SBAR .
and RB VBN .
we also brought one of these dies@@ el ag@@ gre@@ gates to the hall , in the same size as it is there , for the complete dynamic behavior of this network to actually be , so in the hall it looks PP SINV , SINV .
over here NP VP , the c@@ able &apos;s kilometer physics , TO VP , so TO VP , in DT NN .
and RB MD NP VP .
PRP MD ADVP VP .
PRP MD VP RB PRP MD VP , and PDT DT JJ NNS RB .
and what we did , the hall was comple@@ ted in CD CD CC CD , and until today , two thousand and t@@ wel@@ ve , we developed prac@@ tically everything WDT VP .
so we &apos;re not battery manufac@@ tur@@ ers , but define ourselves as NP SBAR .
PRP VBP S , and DT VBZ ADJP .
the nice thing about DT NN is that PP , NP VP .
so this whole discussion as to WHADVP S , the energy revolution , how to VB NP ADVP , PP , PP , we have twenty - five - thirty percent ex@@ cess energy , so we have to VB NP .
RB RB DT VBZ NP PP .
JJ NNS VBP NP ADVP .
we can VB S .
that means IN S .
you can he@@ ed DT NN IN S , IN S , yes , that should definitely be VBN , but you &apos;ll never be JJ S .
and DT VBZ NP .
DT VBZ SBAR .
if PRP VBP PRT NP , then you will no longer have NP , SBAR .
and our european energy grid RB consi@@ sts IN NP , WHADVP S .
we look into this network , see DT CD NN , and if it turns IN NP , we start to VB NP , then a little more ste@@ am can enter , and then it goes up again .
DT VBZ NP .
ADVP NN WHNP S .
IN S , PRP VBZ NP .
DT JJ NN VBZ ADVP S .
and IN NP PRP MD VP .
if NP VP , then you have VP .
and IN NP PRP MD VP .
RB PRP VB SBAR .
and so the message is this , we have VP , if we actually want VP .
and RB PRP VBP S .
ADJP RB VBZ SBAR .
yes , this is DT JJ NN IN NP , JJ NN IN NP , or NN NNS , IN S .
and we &apos;re just trying VP .
RB JJ NNS VBP VP .
and to DT NN people always come and look IN NP .
and UH , DT NN RB VBZ PP .
and many discus@@ sions NP VP were JJ PP .
you can VB S .
PRP VBP NP .
DT NNS JJ .
and i simply assu@@ me IN S .
NP VP , DT VBZ SBAR .
RB MD VP .
the nice thing is IN S .
we &apos;ve VBN VP .
DT MD VP .
so you &apos;re VP , QP NN rene@@ w@@ able energi@@ es is right .
and WHADVP S , RB PRP VBZ PP .
up ti@@ ll ADVP NP VP , NP VP , they have their own little network , WDT VP .
the NP VP fossil or nuclear fu@@ els WDT VP , then they &apos;re an island .
RB PRP VBP RB VP .
and that is RB PP and i am JJ PP IN NP that PRP VBD , S .
and that &apos;s what PRP VBP S , and so in this sense we &apos;re coming RB , also if you look at DT NN by NN NN , that NP VP .
and yes , well , i &apos;d RB IN S and have DT NN .
and you really have VP .
VBP NP .
one day , NML NNS NN steve lo@@ pe@@ z was VBG PP SBAR .
and the source was NP ADJP , VP .
and i &apos;m telling a story that JJ IN NP know , because steve &apos;s colum@@ ns became the basis for a book , WDT VP , with NN NNP NN VBG PP , and NNP NNP IN NP .
na@@ than@@ iel dro@@ pped IN IN NP , he suff@@ ered DT JJ NN , and CD NNS later he was VBG ADJP .
i encoura@@ ge all of you to read steve &apos;s book or to watch the movie TO VP .
PRP VBD NP PP , PP , PP .
he VBD ADVP VP and VBD ADVP and VBD NP .
he was speaking in DT ADJP NN IN NP and how the do@@ d@@ gers were never going VP , all because PP pas@@ sage work in the last movement of NNP &apos;s fourth sym@@ ph@@ ony .
and we got VP , and i got DT NN IN NP DT JJ NNS ADVP VP .
now , i should mention NP VP .
but as a result now , he is pr@@ one to DT JJ NNS , WHNP S and RB VP , VP .
and na@@ than@@ iel was in PDT DT NN IN NP when NP VP -- NP VP , NP VP .
and PRP VBD VP .
and i was afraid , not for myself , but i was afraid that i was VBG S , that he was VBG S , and that i would VB NP PP SBAR .
RB , PRP RB VBD S .
and PRP VBD NP .
and IN S , PRP VBD SBAR .
it was as if NP VP .
and NP NP VBD VP .
and in a mira@@ cle , he li@@ f@@ ted his own vi@@ o@@ lin and he started playing , IN NP , NP PP .
and we started VBG PP , from NP CC NP , PDT DT NN up IN NP .
and i understood IN S .
he spoke IN NP IN NP WHNP S .
and through playing NN and talking IN NP , this man had trans@@ formed from DT ADJP NN WHNP S .
NN VBZ NP . NN VBZ NP .
and IN NP , NN VBZ NP .
because NN VBZ S .
and DT VBZ NP .
and PRP VBD SBAR .
this was the very reason why PRP VBD NP , SBAR , and through our arti@@ stic l@@ ens , through our creativity , we &apos;re able to VB NP PP .
and NP PP VP CC VP , VP CC VP .
and IN NP , NN VBD NP ADVP PP .
DT JJ NN IN NP brought PRP RB IN NP .
and i will always make NN IN NP , IN S .

IN NP VP , NP , NP , NP , NP : NP VP .
but WP VBP NP VP ?
WP VP ? &quot;
well , he goes on TO VP .
NP , NP , NP , NP VP .
NP VP , PRP VBZ S .
RB VBZ NP .
RB VBN PP ?
later that day , i was driving around DT NN IN NP , and i asked him , i said , &quot; for DT NN WHNP S , unlike like any farm i &apos;d ever been at , how do you measure success ? &quot;
IN NP , PRP VBD SBAR .
and we ro@@ unded DT NN and saw NP : NP .
NN WHNP S .
NP PP , JJ .
PRP VBP NP . &quot;
fe@@ ast@@ ing ? PRP VBD ADJP .
NP VP , NN NN , NP NP ? &quot;
NN FRAG .
&quot; NP VP .
UH , JJ NN , DT NN VBD NP .
it &apos;s VBN , NP PP . &quot;
PRP VBD , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , isn &apos; t DT JJ NN NN IN NP PRP VBP PP ? &quot;
PRP VBD NP .
PRP VBD , SBAR .
DT VBZ NP .
DT NNS VBP NP .
DT NNS VBP NP .
so NP NP , DT JJR DT NN . &quot;
okay , so let NP NP : NP SBAR , and NP SBAR .
DT NN NN , but ADVP DT NN NN .
oh , and by NP , NP , they shouldn NP ADVP VP .
NP PP NP RB , WHADVP S .
DT NN , PRP VBP PP .
and NP-TMP , NP VP .
PRP VBP NP SBAR .
no kid@@ ding .
NP VP , so NP VP .
PRP VBD , SQ , and RB do PRP VB ADVP ?
do PRP VBP NP PP ? &quot;
PRP VBD PP SBAR .
NP VP ; NP VP . &quot;
i didn S -- and i don JJ NN IN NP ; i don JJ NN IN S , i don JJ NN IN NP cris@@ p@@ y .
PRP VBZ SBAR .
PRP RB RB VB PP .
yet , WRB NP VP , it ta@@ sted not PP .
PRP VBD ADJP , SBAR .
PRP VBD SBAR .
PRP VBD , S .
PRP VBZ NP SBAR .
PRP VBD PP . &quot;
and RB PRP VBD , SBAR . &quot;
ok . a farm WDT VP .
and then i realized when PRP VP , VP , SBAR , SBAR .
it &apos;s NP NP : NP , NP .
and WRB NP VP , the water is ADJP PP .
NP VP , PRP VBZ NP .
so , not just a farm that doesn JJ NN NN PRP$ NNS , not just DT NN WHNP S &apos;s literally a water pu@@ ri@@ fication plant -- and not just for those fish , but for you and me as well .
IN S , PRP VBZ PRT PP .
a drop in DT NN , NP VP , but S , CC SINV , is also in@@ struc@@ tive .
you might VB SBAR .
WP NP VP is NP , SBAR .
but IN NP , DT VBZ S .
NP VP ; PRP VBP NP .
PRP VBP SBAR , PRP VBP NP , PRP VBP PP , PRP VBP NP .
and when you suggest S , somewhere stands up and says , &quot; hey guy , i love p@@ ink fl@@ amin@@ gos , but WRB VBP NP VP ? &quot;
WRB VBP NP VP ?
can PRP VB ADJP ?
PRP VBP NP .
UH , RB IN S .
QP NNS MD VP .
QP -- NP , RB NP .
now , i don NP NP IN S .
feed grain to NP , NP has simply asked , &quot; if we &apos;re VP , how terrible could that be ? &quot;
IN NP , PRP VBZ VP : PRP VBZ VP .
we should call PRP WHNP S .
NP VP , and NP VP .
PRP$ NN VBZ VP .
not by DT JJS S and tra@@ ctor invention , but by NP : RRC : PP , CC PP : and not by VBG NP , but by fish in DT NN .
VB S ?
VP : WRB VBP NP VP ?
or RB : SBARQ NP SBAR VBP NP S ?
VP , VB NP PP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
PRP VBZ ADJP , and PRP VBZ ADVP VP .
RB , VB S .
DT VBZ NP .
VB PP .
far@@ ms that VBP NP PP ; far@@ ms that VBP PP ; far@@ ms that VBP ADVP ; farmers that VBP RB NP .
IN S , RB .
and if NP VP , they &apos;re DT JJR NN IN S .
PRP VBP , i &apos;m JJ PP , IN S .
VBP NP .
if i can leave you with one big idea today , it &apos;s that the whole of the data in WDT PRP VBP is greater that DT NN PP , CC RB PP is WHADVP S and we can VB NP .
RB WHNP S VBZ NP .
NP SBAR VBZ NP .
it &apos;s VBN NP , and with NP VP -- say , NNS .
and , RB RB , PRP VBP SBAR .
DT VBZ SBAR , and IN ADVP PRP VBP PP .
we can VB ADVP ADVP and RB VB NP PP .
if S CC S -- say CD NNS QP -- we see IN S .
and IN S , PRP VBZ ADVP NP .
so you get DT NN IN S .
and SBAR , WRB RB S ?
RB WHNP S VBD ADJP .
NP VP ; NP VP .
PRP MD VP .
IN NP , PRP MD VP .
PRP MD VP .
PRP MD VP .
RB PRP VBP S ; PRP VBP NP .
i &apos;m a NN NN fan , so i &apos;ll VB ADVP and i &apos;ll VB PP .
now , if NP VP , i might VB , &quot; RB , what about VP ? &quot;
RB PRP MD VP .
and PRP VBP NP ADVP .
and so you get the idea that WHADVP S , PRP VBP RB NP .
PRP VBP S .
NP VP , and NP VP .
RB PRP VBP S .
WHNP S VBZ SBAR and PRP VBD NP PRT PP .
so the sum@@ mary consi@@ sts IN NP VP .
PRP VBP ADVP VP .
but ADVP IN NP , PRP MD VP .
RB RB , PRP VBP NP .
PRP VBP VP .
now , having VBN NP , i can now see IN S .
RB DT VBZ ADJP SBAR .
PRP VBZ ADJP S .
looking IN NP , i can then dri@@ ll IN NP , VP .
so looking at DT NNS , i can see that NP VP ; some have come from JJ NNS ; some , fewer still , have come from NN -- there &apos;s my bo@@ ss -- and one has come from NN .
and RB RB , FW VBZ ADVP NP .
RB PRP MD VP .
so you see , we &apos;re VBG NP PP SBAR .
and RB PRP VBP S .
PRP VBP ADVP VP .
so pi@@ vo@@ t , this app@@ lic@@ ation -- i don S ; PRP VBZ PP , but PRP MD VP -- and we bring DT JJ NN IN NP .
RB PRP MD VP .
now the reason WRB NP VP is because , by NP PP , i can look at NP PP .
RB PRP MD VP .
RB , IN NP , VBZ NP .
and PRP MD VP .
and , if i want to VP CC VP , i can sli@@ ce and NNS PRP$ NN , RB by my search history -- here , i was doing some ne@@ po@@ ti@@ stic se@@ arch@@ ing , VBG PP pi@@ vo@@ t .
and IN NP , PRP MD VP .
it &apos;s NP VP , and in DT NN it makes DT JJ JJR IN NP .
RB RB RB , IN NP , PRP VBP PP .
PRP VBP PP .
PRP VBP PP .
what if we can actually turn that up@@ side down and turn the web up@@ side down , so that PP , NP VP , and ADVP VP ?
IN S , PRP MD ADVP VP .
and , PP , PRP MD VP .
and IN S RB RB VBZ NP S .
RB PP , PRP VBP NP .
PRP VBD PRT PP .
IN NP , PRP VBD NP PP NP-TMP .
and i was always absor@@ bed PP , CC ADJP , in NP , NP .
and you know , that curi@@ osity also mani@@ fest@@ ed itself in the fact that WHADVP S PRP VBD ADVP PP , UCP .
NP VP , PRP VBD NP .
but PRP VBD ADVP VP .
and my love of science fi@@ ction actually seemed mir@@ r@@ or@@ ed in DT NN IN NP , because SBAR , NP VP , NP VP , NP VP .
jac@@ ques cou@@ ste@@ au was coming IN NP IN NP .
RB , IN S .
and PRP VBD NP .
PRP MD VP . PRP MD VP .
and i found that IN S , PRP VBD S .
you know , we all did , IN S , and IN NP , VB NP PP .
and so , my response to DT was TO VP .
PRP VBD ADVP VP .
NP VP -- NP VP .
and an interesting thing happened : DT NNS S RB VBD S SBAR .
PRP MD RB ADVP VP .
but that was DT NN S .
RB , PRP VBD SBAR .
and DT JJ NN IN NP was IN S .
but PRP VBP S .
i pe@@ ster@@ ed PRP$ NN IN S .
and i actually got VBN PP PP .
and i didn NP VP , IN S .
since RB , IN NP , PRP VBP VP , and NP PP VBD PP .
and i &apos;ve learned IN S .
NP NP VBZ ADJP PP .
PRP RB , to DT NN , VB PP .
and NP PP VBZ ADJP SBAR .
but WHADVP S , PRP VBD VP .
and that seemed VP .
and NP VP , and RB RB .
RB , NN VBD NP .
and of course DT NNS WHNP S were NML NNS : &quot; ter@@ min@@ ator , &quot; &quot; ali@@ ens &quot; and &quot; the ab@@ y@@ ss . &quot;
CC PP NP PRP VBD VP .
RB , PRP VBP , S .
something interesting came out of &quot; the ab@@ y@@ ss , &quot; which VBD NP .
and DT VBD PP .
and even though the film didn &apos; t make DT NN -- bar@@ ely broke RB , i should say -- i wit@@ n@@ essed NN ADJP , which is IN S .
NP VP , PRP VBZ SBAR .
PRP VBD VP .
and ADVP IN S .
and i thought , IN S . &quot;
RB , IN NP , PRP VBD ADVP .
working IN NP , we created the JJ NN du@@ de in DT NN . the success hung in DT NN on IN S .
and it did , and PRP VBD NP ADVP , and PRP VBD NP PP : SBAR .
so , drawing a line through NP PP came to , VB SBAR , VB SBAR .
so , i started NP PP , NP , SBAR and NP PP , and it was called JJ NN .
and DT NN IN NP was SBAR CC ADVP , and we would VB ADVP .
and NP ADVP VP and NP VP .
but we found ourselves VBG PP .
so , i wrote this piece called &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar , &quot; WDT VP , and the main characters would all be in c@@ g , and the world would be in c@@ g .
and the en@@ vel@@ op@@ e pus@@ hed RB , and i was VBN PP SBAR .
RB , NP VP , and NP VP .
you know , PRP VP CC VP NP PP : VP , passionate film . &quot;
secre@@ tly , WDT NP VP was S JJ . &quot;
and DT VBZ SBAR .
and DT VBZ NP . RB , DT NML JJ NN VBP SBAR .
but i convinced them . i said , &quot; NP VP . we &apos;re going VP .
PRP VBD VP .
PRP MD VP . PRP MD VP . &quot;
and PRP VBD NP PP .
VBZ ADJP . but DT VBZ ADVP PP .
because we actually created DT NN WHADVP FRAG , i find myself in DT JJ JJ NP RB PP , looking IN NP .
RB NP , RB VP .
RB , IN S .
and PRP VBD NP , we had VP .
but , PRP VBD NP SBAR .
NP VP , and NP VP .
you get IN NP , you go down IN NP WRB NP VP .
and PRP VBD S . PRP VBP INTJ , S .
DT VBZ ADJP . &quot;
and RB , PRP RB VBD VP .
of course , the curi@@ osity , DT NN NN IN NP -- it was NN . it was NN , it was NN , it was NN .
and PRP VBD NP .
because , you know , i could VB NP and we could VB NP PP . but i couldn JJ NN VB SBAR .
as we did DT IN NP , i was seeing creatures at hydro@@ ther@@ mal v@@ ents and sometimes things that i had RB VBN NP , that actually were not described by science at DT NN WHNP S .
RB , PRP VP , CC VP .
and RB , PRP RB VBD NP .
after the success of NP , SBAR , &quot; ok , i &apos;m going TO VP , and i &apos;m going TO VP . &quot;
and RB , PRP VBD S and PRP VBP PRT S .
PRP VBD ADVP PP .
PRP VBD NP SBAR .
and the idea was VP .
nobody had RB VBN PP . PRP VBP SBAR , so PRP VBD NP S .
so , you know , here i am now , on NP PP , VP , CC VP .
and PRP VBP S .
WHADVP S , NP PP VBZ PP .
PRP VBD SBAR .
and it was the most sur@@ real kind of de@@ ja v@@ u experience i &apos;ve ever had , because i would know before NP VP .
and DT NN VBD VP .
RB , PRP VBD NP .
and it really made me realize IN S .
NP VP , ADVP ADJP .
and it may be a little bit of a gli@@ mp@@ se as to what MD VP .
so , having done these expedi@@ tions , and really beginning to VB SBAR where we had DT JJ , JJ NNS -- NP VP .
PRP VBP PP .
PRP VBP SBAR .
and ADVP , NP VP you think S .
at the same time i was getting NP PP ADVP : ADVP .
and i wo@@ und up getting involved with DT NN NN , really involved with NNP , sitting on the nasa ad@@ vis@@ ory board , planning actual space mis@@ sions , going to russi@@ a , going through the pre-@@ co@@ s@@ mon@@ aut bi@@ ome@@ di@@ cal proto@@ col@@ s , and PDT DT NNS IN NP , to actually go and fly to NP PP .
and DT VBD ADJP .
but WHNP S VBD VP .
and taking them down so that PRP VBD NP -- taking them down to the v@@ ents , and le@@ tting them VB , and VB NP , and RB RB .
RB , ADVP NP VP , but ADVP VP .
i &apos;d RB VBN NP , you know , as DT NN , and VBG NP .
and PRP VBP SBAR .
i learned a lot about science . but i also learned a lot now PRP VBP SBAR .
PRP VBP S .
IN S WP VBP NP VP ?
WRB VBP NP VP ? WP VBP NP VP ? &quot;
PRP VBP SBAR .
PRP RB VBP ADVP . RB VBZ NP .
people sort of think PRP VP CC VP .
VP , VBD NP PP .
DT NN , DT NN , DT NN . WP VBP NP VP ?
you &apos;re doing it for NP ADVP , for DT NN -- and the ocean is the most challen@@ ging environment EX VBZ : PP SBAR .
because PRP MD VP , sometimes at NN IN NP , three months at a time .
and in that bon@@ d , you realize that the RBS JJ thing is NP SBAR , that you &apos;ve VBN NP .
when you come back to the sh@@ ore and you say , &quot; we had to do this , and DT NML , and DT NN , and DT ADJP that , all the technology of it , and the diffic@@ ul@@ ty , the human - performance aspe@@ cts of working at sea , &quot; you can &apos; t explain it to people . it &apos;s that thing that maybe cop@@ s have , or people in NN WHNP S and they know they can never explain it .
VP , VBZ NP PP .
so , when i came RB VP i tried to VB NP , and you ear@@ n their respect in return .
and PRP RB VBD NP .
so , RB PRP VBD ADVP PP , PP , S , &quot; coming RP IN NP exist before .
tremend@@ ously exciting .
tremend@@ ously challen@@ ging .
and PRP VBD NP , PP .
and PRP RB VBD SBAR .
so , NNS VBP VP , you brought RP DT NN NNS and put PRP IN NP . &quot;
to PRP , it was NP PP .
RB , WP MD NP VP ?
S , WP VBP NP VP ?
UH , PRP VBP SBAR .
PRP VBZ NP .
NN VBZ NP .
and NP PP VBZ ADJP .
i have NP SBAR . &quot;
and PRP VP , VP VP .
other people will VP : VP , VP , CC VP . &quot;
NP VP : NP VP . &quot;
but failure has VP .
and NP SBAR VBD VP .
PRP VBP S .
so , NP VP , is IN S , but fear is not . thank you .
PRP VBP VP .
and that might seem a bit surprising because NP PP VBZ ADVP PP , PP .
but energy and climate VBP ADJP PP : PP , ADJP IN NP .
the climate getting worse means that NP VP will change in NNS that NP ADVP VP .
and NP VP , NP VP , S .
RB , DT NN NNS MD VP .
RB , NP PP VBZ ADJP .
in fact , if PRP MD VP , by far you would pick NN .
RB , NP PP VBZ VP .
RB JJ NN VBZ VP .
the coal revolution fu@@ el@@ ed the industrial revolution , and , even in the 19@@ 0@@ 0s we &apos;ve seen a very ra@@ pid dec@@ line in DT NN IN NP , and that &apos;s WRB NP VP , air - conditioning , we can VB NP and do so many things .
and RB , PRP VBP PP PP .
but , as we VBP S -- and VB NP go for VBG S : SBAR .
NP VP , and NP VP .
if you sum up the co2 WDT VP : the effects on DT NN ; perhaps worse , the indi@@ rect effects , in that the natural eco@@ systems can &apos; NN ad@@ just to these ra@@ pid changes , and so you get ecosystem collap@@ ses .
now , the ex@@ act amount of WHADVP S , but not very much .
and RB VBZ ADVP NP PP .
i asked S ?
VP PRP RB VBD NP PP ?
and DT NN VBZ SBAR .
and IN DT VBZ NP .
it &apos;s RB JJ PP , and we can RB RB PP . &quot;
DT VBZ NP .
RB , PRP VBD PRT NP , PP .
IN S , PRP VBZ NP ; IN NP , PRP VBZ NP .
PRP VBZ NP PP .
and , RB , PRP VBP S .
PRP VBZ VP .
it &apos;s NP SBAR , so we have VP .
this equ@@ ation has four fac@@ tors , a little bit of multi@@ pli@@ cation : so , you &apos;ve got a thing on the left , co2 , that NP VP , and that NP VP , the energy on JJ IN NP , and the co2 being put RP IN NP .
so , let NP VP .
RB , NP PP VBZ VP .
ADVP NP VP , but VP .
RB , PRP VBP SBAR .
DT NN NN VBZ NP .
DT VBZ VP .
now , if we do DT ADJP NN IN NP , we could lower that by , RB , NML NN , but there we see an increase of QP .
DT JJ NN VBZ NP .
DT VBZ NP .
DT VBP NP : VP VBZ S .
and PRP VBZ NP .
in the rich world , perhaps the top one billion , we probably could cut back and use less , but every year , this number , on average , is going TO VP , and so , over all , that will more than double DT NNS VBN PP .
RB PRP VBP NP : do PRP VB NP ?
and , in NN , these kids don JJ NN , IN S .
RB , NP , NP , NP , RB RB PRP VBP NP .
PRP VBP NP .
through various inven@@ tions and new ways of VP , through different types of cars , different ways of building buildings -- EX VBP NP bring it down by 90 percent .
there are JJ NNS IN SBAR .
and so , over@@ all here , if PRP VBP ADJP , we may VB NP S .
but for these first three fac@@ tors now , we &apos;ve VBN PP PP , at best , QP NNS , and DT ADJP JJ NN cut PRP .
so let NP VP -- this is VBG S -- and this is NP PP .
CC S : MD NP VP ?
IN S , DT .
IN S , DT .
NP SBAR , VBZ PRT NP .
and so , WP NP VP , is VB NP .
and RB , PRP VBP NP .
RB , WHADVP S , NP SBAR VB NP .
DT NN VBZ NP . DT JJ NN VBZ NP .
NP CC NP VBP NP .
RB , DT NNS RB VBP VP .
usually , we don S .
RB , NP ADVP VP , and NP VP .
this is NP SBAR .
RB , PRP VBD , SBAR ?
is RB NP PP , NP SBAR ? &quot;
NP VP , and ADVP NP VP .
PRP RB VBD S , PRP VBP , EX VBP NP .
RB , IN NP , NP SBAR VBZ NP .
PRP VBD SBAR .
RB RB PRP VBP NP .
NP VP ; PP , NP VP .
RB , EX VBZ NP PP , but PRP VBP S .
we need NP : NP : WHNP S , and , although EX VBZ NP people are see@@ king , i really only see CD WHNP S .
PRP VBP VP .
those may make some contribu@@ tion , and if they can do better than NP VP , so much the better , but my key point here is that we &apos;re going VP , and we can &apos; t give up DT IN NP because they look JJ , IN S .
VB S .
what you need to VB ADVP , seems like it might be JJ , but it &apos;s not , and that &apos;s to VP , VP , VP , put it somewhere , and hope PRP VBZ ADVP .
now we have some pilot things that do S , but the tou@@ gh@@ est one here is this long - term issue .
WP VP ?
who &apos;s VP ?
DT VBZ NP .
so DT VBZ NP .
RB MD VP .
it also has three big problems : cost , particularly in highly regul@@ ated countries , is high ; the issue of the safety , RB VBG ADJP PP could go wrong , that , even though NP VP , that DT NML JJ NN VBP VP .
and RB WP VBP NP VP ?
and , IN S , NP VP .
NP SBAR , MD VP .
NP PP , PRP VBP VP .
DT VBP SBAR .
and PRP RB -- IN S -- PRP VBP NP .
CD VBZ SBAR .
this is NN NN , so you &apos;re NML ADVP NN IN S .
RB , DT VBP NP .
the sun doesn &apos; t sh@@ ine all day , it doesn NP NP , and , ADVP , DT ADJP NN NN all the time .
and so , if PRP VBP PP , you have TO VP .
so , we &apos;ve VP , we have trans@@ mission challenges : for example , say NP VP ; NP CONJP VP , but you have to deal IN NP .
and NP NP .
and , to dimension@@ alize this , i went through and looked at NP PP , and what i found is that all the bat@@ ter@@ ies we make now could store less than 10 minutes of all the energy .
and so , in fact , we need a big break@@ through here , NN WHNP S .
NP VP , but NP VP .
now , this shows up WRB NP VP .
IN S , PRP VBP NP .
RB , WHADVP S ?
is PRP DT NN NN ? WP VP ?
UH , PRP VBP NP .
IN NP , PRP VBP NP .
and NP PP , you VBP NP PP and VB , VP . &quot; NP VP .
and , NP VP , here IN NP , we have NP SBAR .
NN JJ VBZ NP , PP .
vin@@ od k@@ ho@@ s@@ la VBZ S and VBP NP , and i &apos;m VBG S .
NNP NNP and PRP actually are VBG NP .
EX VBP NP .
and innovation really stopped in DT NN quite NP IN , so NP VP .
the idea of ter@@ ra@@ power is that , RB IN S , NN VBD S . &quot;
PRP VBZ ADVP .
in fact , people had talked about it for a long time , but they could never simu@@ late proper@@ ly whether it would VB or not , and so it &apos;s IN NP WHNP S .
and , IN S , NP VP .
PRP RB VBP PRT NP , and PRP MD ADVP VP .
RB , RB IN S , PRP RB VBP NP . PRP VBZ NP .
PRP VBZ NP SBAR .
PRP MD VP .
IN NP , DT RB VBZ NP .
PRP VBP SBAR .
this is NP , SBAR , so it &apos;s VBN NP .
DT MD VP .
and , simply by VBG NN IN NP , you &apos;d VP .
so , NP VP , it &apos;s S , but it is NP PP .
RB VB NP VP ?
WP MD NP VP ?
well , let NP VP .
IN NP , PRP VBP SBAR .
DT RB VBZ ADJP , SBAR .
and that CD NN MD VP hopefully we will have VBN PRT NP .
so , to VB PP , will have VBN S .
so , the other grade is : are PRP VBG NP , have NP VP developed countries and we &apos;re in NP PP ?
DT NNS RB JJ .
DT VBZ NP .
RB , VP DT CD NN NN VBP PP ?
UH , RB , PRP MD VP .
we should go IN NP VP : the less NP VP , the less the temperature .
but in some ways , the grade we get there , doing things that VBP S , is only equ@@ ally , or maybe even slightly less , important than the other , WDT VP .
these break@@ through@@ s , we need VP , and we can VB NP PP .
RB NP NP IN NP .
the al VB NP , VB NP PP . &quot;
they really VB PP and VB NP SBAR .
RB NP SBAR .
RB DT VBZ NP .
PRP VBZ NP .
if you gave me only one wish for the next 50 years -- i could pick WP VP , i could pick DT NN , WHNP S , or i could pick that NP VP -- this is the wish i would pick .
DT VBZ NP .
if we don &apos; t get DT NN , the di@@ vision between the people WP VP will be terrible , IN NP and rich , and most of all the lives of DT QP will be far worse .
RB , WP VBP NP VP ?
WP VBP NP VP ?
PRP VBP S .
WHADVP S , PRP VBD S .
PRP MD VP , and PRP VBD VP .
we do VB NP .
PRP VBP S .
we need VP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
VBP NP .
VBP NP .
VBP NP . VBP NP .
thank you . so TO VP , first of all , can you give NP PP ?
bi@@ l gates : to actually do the software , buy the super@@ computer , hi@@ re all the great scientists , which we &apos;ve VBN , that &apos;s RB QP , and even once NP VP you &apos;ll only VB ADVP PP .
the tough thing is VBG NP ; VBG NP , VBG NP , NP SBAR .
once you get the first one built , if PRP VBZ SBAR .
and so , to understand it right , this invol@@ ves building deep into the ground almost like NP PP , PP , and then the process starts at DT NN and NN of works down ?
b@@ g : that &apos;s right . today , you &apos;re always re@@ fu@@ el@@ ing the re@@ actor , so you have NNS IN NP IN NP .
so , if you have NP SBAR put it down and not have those same comple@@ xi@@ ties .
and NP VP , and ADVP NP VP .
PRP VBZ NP .
b@@ g : yeah . well , what happens with DT NN , you can let it VB ADVP NP : PRN and VB NP .
and we start off actually by VBG NP .
so , the thing WDT VP is actually WP VP , and you &apos;re VBG NP RB RB IN S .
NP VP , PRP VBP VP .
WRB VBZ NP ?
b@@ g : well , we haven &apos; t picked a particular place , and there &apos;s all these interesting dis@@ clo@@ sure rules about anything that VBZ VP -- i &apos;ve been back seeing the secre@@ t@@ ary of energy here , talking about WHADVP S .
RB PRP VBP ADJP . NP VP , DT ADJP VBP VP .
DT VBZ NP .
it &apos;s an important ad@@ v@@ ance , but it &apos;s like DT JJ NN , and DT NN IN NP have VBN NP , so NN WHNP S is DT NN S .
RB , IN NP , NP PP ?
b@@ g : UH , PRP VBP -- IN NP , PRP VBP NP .
NP RB PP IN S .
and , NP VP -- could RB VB NP .
and there are , fortunately now , do@@ zens of NNS -- we need it to VB NP , ADVP , if PRP$ NN VBZ ADVP , if the fund@@ ing for PRP$ NN NNS goes well , that NP VP .
and PRP VBZ ADJP , SBAR .
PRP RB VBP NP S .
IN NP , is DT DT JJS WHNP S ?
NNP : NP VP .
PRP MD VP , but DT JJ NN RB VBZ S .
IN NP , EX VBP NP .
you know , PRP VBP SBAR , but DT JJ NNS , DT &apos;s DT JJ NN .
ADVP NP , but ADVP NP VP .
and so , there are different ones , but the beauty of this is a molecule of ur@@ ani@@ um has a CD NNS as much energy as NP PP , and RB -- if you can deal with the nega@@ tives , which are RB DT NN -- the foot@@ print and cost , the potential , in terms of effect on land and various things , is almost in a class of its own .
IN NP NP , RRC ?
do PRP VBP S ?
b@@ g : if PRP VBP PP , it &apos;s like if NP VP , and you &apos;re about TO VP ? you may need heart surgery or something .
there is a line of NP PP ge@@ o@@ engineering , which VBP NP .
RB , IN NP RB NP .
PRP VBP S .
some people say you shouldn JJ NN RB VB PP SBAR , that PRP VBP VP .
i &apos;m not sure that NP ADJP , VBN NP , but EX VBZ ADVP NP in case things happen RBR , or this innovation goes a lot slo@@ wer than PRP VBP ?
climate skep@@ tics : IN S , WRB MD NP VP ?
NNP : INTJ , ADVP , NP VP .
NP SBAR VBP ADJP .
are PRP VBG SBAR ?
EX VBP NP &apos;s DT NN IN NP .
NP SBAR , PRP VBZ ADVP PP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
and so , when you have all sorts of ur@@ gent problems , DT NN IN S that has TO VP , that &apos;s not necessarily the worst case , and there are people in the rich world who look IN NP and say , &quot; ok , that isn &apos; t that big of a deal . &quot;
DT NN VBZ SBAR .
but my dream here is that , if PRP MD VP , RB DT NNS VBP , &quot; ok , i don &apos; t care that it doesn JJ NN VBD PRT NP , i kind of wish it did put out co2 , but i guess i &apos;ll accept it because it &apos;s ADJP PP . &quot;
and so , that would be your response to the b@@ j@@ or@@ n l@@ om@@ bor@@ g argument , that basically if you spend PDT DT NN VBG S , it &apos;s going TO VP and so forth , it &apos;s a stupid waste of the earth &apos;s resources to put money towards that when there are NP SBAR .
b@@ g : well , NP PP ; LST NP -- say S -- it &apos;s RB IN FRAG .
PRP VBD S .
the thing you get into big money on , and this , reas@@ on@@ able people can VB , is when NP VP and NP VP -- that , IN NP , RB VBZ NP .
unless PRP VBP ADJP and PRP VBP ADVP VP and PRP VBZ S , i believe PRP MD VP .
if NP VP , &quot; RB DT JJ can VB NP .
PRP VBP , DT IN NP here could VP CC RB VP .
DT NN VBZ PP .
and RB NN VBZ VP .
NP ADVP VP ; LST VP ? &quot;
he &apos;s still , because of PRP$ JJR NN , still associated IN NP , but he &apos;s realized IN FRAG , and so , he &apos;s VBG NP .
and RB RB VBZ NP .
NP : NP , NP VP .
well bill , i sus@@ pe@@ ct NP VP . thank you so much .
NNP : VBP NP .
NP IN NP , NNP NNP VBD SBAR .
and the idea &apos;s pretty simple : teams of CD have TO VP .
DT NN VBZ S .
and , though NP VP , PRP VBZ ADVP ADVP .
and ADVP , NP VP , and NP VP .
and PRP VBD NP .
and since then , i &apos;ve condu@@ cted about 70 design work@@ sh@@ ops across NP PP and NP , NP , and there &apos;s something about this exercise WDT VP , and i &apos;d like to share NP PP IN NP .
RB , RB , JJS NNS VBP PP .
PRP VBP PP , PRP VBP PRT SBAR , PRP NP PP .
ADVP NP VP , NP VP and NP VP .
PRP VBP NP .
and then finally , just as they &apos;re running out S , CC NP ! -- they ad@@ mi@@ re their work .
but what really happens , most of the time , is that DT NNP NNP HYPH NNP NNP VBZ PP u@@ h-@@ oh , &quot; because NP VP .
so EX VBP NP u@@ h-@@ oh &quot; moments IN NP , and IN NP are JJ NNS IN NP .
NP VP , NP VP , NP VP and NP VP .
and of course there are NP SBAR .
and PRP VBZ ADJP .
IN S PRP VBP NP , but PRP VBP NP .
RB DT NN S VBZ : SBARQ WRB ? WP VBZ NP PP ?
and peter li@@ kes VP . right ?
PRP VBP SBAR .
but RB VBZ NP ADVP .
and DT NN VBZ SBAR ?
and RB PRP VB PP .
and then WP VP is , WHADVP S , SBAR CC SBAR ?
PRP VBZ NP .
NN JJ ? right .
what kinder@@ gar@@ ten@@ ers do RB is that PRP VBP PP , and they build NNS , JJ NNS , always keeping DT NN IN NP , so PRP VBP NP .
NNS VBP NP PP .
and IN NP , NNS VBP NP PP .
RB DT NN S VBZ ADJP , but VB S .
so the average for JJS NNS is RB CD in@@ ches ; business schools students , QP IN NP ; law@@ yers , NP JJR , CC RB RB JJR PP , better than JJS NNS .
WP VP ?
NNS CC NNS , RB .
QP NNS VBZ NP .
and why is PRP ? IN S and ADJP JJ NNS are NP PP .
so NP , NP , CC RB VBZ SBAR .
IN S VB NP . IN NP , PRP VBP ADJP .
it &apos;s JJ . PRP VBP , you look RB , S , &quot; NP VP . &quot;
PRP MD ADVP VP . and WRB VBZ NP ?
because NP VP .
NP VP , PRP VBP NP .
and NP SBAR MD ADVP VP .
NP CC NP VBP NP .
if NP VP , you &apos;ll VB ADVP NP .
and PRP VBD NP S .
PRP VP , VP , ADVP .
RB PRP VBD NP PP .
RB WP VBP NP VP ?
WP VBD NP ?
RB &apos;s WHNP S : RB CD NN VBD NP .
SBAR , VP , PRP MD VP .
RB , NP NP ? DT JJ NNS VBP NP .
PRP VBD NP ADVP PP .
WP VBP NP VP ?
RB RB PRP VBP NP .
RB DT JJ NN VBD PP .
PRP VBD NP PP .
RB RB VBZ NP PP .
RB , PRP MD VP ?
and the reason is , S .
and WHNP S VBZ SBAR .
RB , RB , DT NN VBZ NP ?
DT NN VBZ NP .
and RB , DT VBZ NP .
and NP SBAR MD VP .
PRP VBZ NP .
RB NNS NML IN NP .
EX VBP NP PP .
RB NP SBAR .
and NP , SBAR , VBZ SBAR .
it dem@@ ands that NP VP , and that NP VP .
and sometimes , a little prototyp@@ e of DT NN is PDT DT S .
and DT MD VP .
VBP NP ADVP .
VB S .
NP VP , and NP VP .
and NP PP VBZ S .
and PRP MD VP .
and i wonder WP S CC S .
i don S . they want VP . &quot;
PRP VBP SBAR .
PRP VBP ADJP SBAR .
and PRP VBP SBAR .
NP VP , PRP VBP S .
NP VP , and NP VP .
NP VP , NP VP , NP VP .
ADVP NP VP , and NP VP .
this is the greatest time ADVP VP ...
RB NP VP .
PRP$ ADJP NNS VBD , NP , PP .
PRP$ NNS VBD NP PP .
PRP$ NNS VBP VP .
RB RB JJR VP .
but PRP VBZ RB PP , SBAR .
DT NN VBN PP NP-TMP can VB S .
VP , PRP VBZ NP .
and WRB VBZ NP ADJP ?
small@@ po@@ x . NN VBD NP PP .
PRP VBD NP SBAR .
PRP VBZ VP . PRP VBZ VP .
PRP VBD NP . pu@@ ff .
in DT JJ NN , NNS WHNP S exist , RB .
NN , NN , NN ...
does NN RB VB SBAR ?
NNS , JJ NN , PRP$ NN S , those are NP PP .
and to my mind , the scientific method -- trying NN IN , seeing IN S , changing PRP WHADVP S -- is one of NP PP .
so DT VBZ NP .
unfortunately , DT VBZ NP SBAR , and PRP VBP VP .
and CD IN NP is IN S .
NP VP , and S , CC S .
and ADVP IN S NP NP .
po@@ table water , ar@@ able land , rain@@ fore@@ sts , oil , gas : they &apos;re VBG ADVP , and they &apos;re VP , and unless NP VP , we &apos;re VP .
RB DT NN VBZ : SQ ? and PRP VBP SBAR .
i think S .
PRP VBP SBAR .
NP ADVP VP , NP PP .
but here &apos;s the thing WDT VP : we &apos;ve never needed NN IN NP . never .
and we &apos;ve RB RB VBN PP S PP .
we &apos;re on the ver@@ ge of amazing , amazing events in JJ NNS , and yet i actually think we &apos;d have to VB PRT NP PP , S when PRP VBD NP , when PRP VBD PP ADVP .
NNS VBP NP PP , and PRP VBP NP ADVP .
not RB DT NN MD VP .
and , VB , everyone &apos;s S : S .
but PRP VBP SBAR ?
PRP VBP RB VP . UH , PRP VBP RB .
and DT VBD NP ADVP S .
IN PP , PRP VBD NP PP . a little story .
and i was JJ S .
PRP VBP SBAR , so PRP RB VBD SBAR : PRP VBD NP and PRP VBD ADVP .
and RB IN NP , PRP VBD NP PP .
JJ NN , RB JJR .
NNS VBD VP .
so i wrote a story about DT too , and i couldn NP VP , was tr@@ es@@ pas@@ sing on nature &apos;s ground .
but , S , PRP VBP SBAR . NP VP , PRP VBD ADVP .
NP VP , PRP VBP NP .
NP VP , NP VP , NP VP . PRP VBZ ADJP .
but NP VP , and S , CC S .
and DT VBZ PP .
PRP VBD NP .
PRP VBD ADVP PP .
and PRP RB VBD NP ADVP .
but ADVP NP VP , NP VP , VP .
we &apos;re IN NP WHADVP S .
PRP VBP PP ADVP .
PRP VBP PP PP . &quot;
UH , NP VP , and NP VP .
we VBP NP PP , and RB VBZ NP .
NP VP and NP VP .
NN , JJ , DT NN , NN , NP PP , VBG NP .
NP VP , PRP MD VP .
EX VBP NP .
VB NP .
VB S .
but here &apos;s the thing : WHADVP S , PRP VBP S , and PRP VBP SBAR .
and the reason WDT NP VP is because NP VP .
RB CD years ago , there was NP VP , NP , SBAR .
very sc@@ ary .
NP PP VBD VP .
NP VP ; NP VP .
DT NNS VBD ADVP .
the data came back from DT JJ NNS , from NNP , from NNP , from NNP , and it was PDT DT JJ : DT NN , DT NN , NN at all .
it doesn &apos; t matter . it doesn JJ NN NN IN S , we believe WHNP S , WHNP S , WHNP SQ .
we don S , and i do VB SBAR .
but PRP VBP SBAR ?
NP PP VBZ VP .
dis@@ a@@ str@@ ous IN S : the united states is NP PP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
PRP VBZ ADJP .
WHNP PP VP ?
RB , PRP VBP NP . PRP VBP VP .
RB , did NN VB NP ADVP ?
has NP PP ADVP VBN NP ?
NN JJ NN VB ADVP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
DT VBZ NP .
but since it didn NP VP , we can put it out IN NP , and people like NNP NNP can go RB VP and &quot; lar@@ ry king live . &quot;
and PRP MD VP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
and PRP VBZ NP .
DT NN VBD NP .
PRP VBD NP ADVP .
DT NN , DT NN . NNP -- NP , VP .
NP PP , RB RB JJ .
PRP$ NN VBZ NP .
PRP RB VBD NP PP .
PRP VBD PP PP .
RB JJ , JJ ?
well , it &apos;s JJ , IN IN S and says SBAR CC SBAR .
and PRP RB VBZ S .
RB , NN VBZ NP .
WHADVP S , PRP MD VP .
he gets VBN PP PP SBAR .
and WRB ? because NP VP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
PRP VBP NP NP . and DT VBZ S .
PRP VBP NP ADVP .
and PRP VBZ S , and RB RB NNS VBP VP .
and PRP VBP RB ADVP VP .
WP IN NP ? VB S . WRB RB ?
DT NN NN IN NP VBD NP PP and VBD SBAR .
DT NN VBZ ADVP VP .
PRP VBD NP S .
fine .
WRB ? IN S VBP NP . and PRP VBP SBAR ?
PRP VBP SBAR .
today , i don S , RB DT NN VBD PP NP-TMP , and PRP VBZ S , right now he &apos;s IN NP .
and he &apos;s VBG S , he &apos;s VBG S , and he &apos;s VBG S , and he &apos;s going VP .
and he doesn NP VP .
DT VBZ NP . VB SBAR NP .
RB , PRP VBP S . PRP VBP S .
NN VB NP NP-TMP ?
NN , DT JJ NN S .
PRP VBP SBAR .
PRP VBP NP , and NP VP , and NP VP .
DT NN VBZ NP NP-TMP .
PRP VBP NP . PRP RB RB VB NP PP .
NP VP , PRP VBP S ?
PRP VBP ADVP PP .
dark ur@@ ine . dark .
WRB VBP NP VP ? WRB VBP NP VP ?
INTJ , NP VP , PRP VBP NP .
PRP VBP NP . PRP VBP NP .
and NP VP : PRP$ NML NN VBZ .
PRP VBZ ADJP .
PRP VBZ ADJP PP .
RB S , and WRB VBP NP VP ?
PRP VBP PP .
DT NNS JJ . PRP VBP NP .
but , NP VP , it &apos;s RB DT JJ NN IN S .
and PRP VBP NP ADVP .
NP PP ... NP , NP ; NP , NP ; ac@@ ai -- i don JJ NN RB VB SBAR -- it &apos;s fr@@ au@@ d .
and you know what ? when PRP VBP NP , NNS VBP PP , and PRP VBP , &quot; what do PRP VB ? let people do WHNP S .
PRP VBZ S . &quot;
and PRP VBP SBAR ? PRP VBP ADJP .
because i don &apos; t care if NP VP , &quot; h@@ mm , i &apos;m not going to VB NP PP .
when PRP VBP ADVP SBAR , you end up in NP SBAR .
PRP VBP PRT PP .
he killed CD IN NP by VP .
NNS IN NNS of NP PP .
UH , VB S .
EX VBP . RB RB VBP .
now , the RBS JJ epidemic NP VP is DT JJ NN IN NP .
PRP VBZ NP . PRP VBZ S .
PRP VBZ NP , PP .
NP VP , PRP VBZ RB NP .
DT JJ NN S has VBN VP .
NP VP , EX VBZ NP PP .
RB NP NP .
RB NP NP . PRP VBD S .
PRP VBD NP PP .
and NP VP , and NP VP .
PRP VBD VP .
now we can do it in DT ADJP NN -- and there are NNS , RB -- but we can put NP PP IN NP , and that stuff can help S .
PRP VBP SBAR ?
NP VP , PRP VBP SBAR .
PRP VBP PP .
WRB VBP NP VP ?
well , the things PRP RB VBP are : too many chemicals , pe@@ sti@@ ci@@ des , hor@@ mon@@ es , NN PRN IN FRAG .
PRP VBP NP S .
PRP VBP SBAR .
and PRP VBP SBAR ?
UH , PRP VBP ADVP . VB S .
NP VP , PRP VBP SBAR .
DT VBZ NP .
NP VP , NP VP , NP VP .
PRP VBP NP .
PRP VBZ RB NP .
NP VP ; NP VP .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn &apos; t , but the idea that PRP MD RB VP , is really very dea@@ den@@ ing , and it &apos;s pre@@ vent@@ ing NP PP IN S .
you know , PP NP VP , 70 percent .
DT NN IN NP IN NP .
dis@@ gra@@ ce@@ ful . dis@@ gra@@ ce@@ ful .
NP VP , and NP VP .
and WRB ? ADJP NN .
PRP VBP SBAR .
NN NNS NN WHNP S .
PRP VBZ ADVP PP .
PRP VBZ NP . PRP VBZ .
PRP VBD SBAR , PRP VBD SBAR , and NNS VBP VP .
and ADVP NP VP and NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP ?
DT MD VP . NP VP , but NP VP .
and DT S VBZ : SBARQ ?
S , VB S
because NP VP ?
DT VBZ PP . PRP VBZ NP .
it &apos;s not IN NP , NP PP .
DT NN JJ NN IN NP is IN S , and it &apos;s IN NP .
RB , PRP VBP NP ?
if we don JJ NN , if we continue VP , we &apos;re gu@@ il@@ ty of NN that PRP VBP SBAR .
ADVP NP DT JJ NN S .
PRP VBZ ADJP , PRP VBZ ADJP , PRP VBZ PP , and PRP RB VBP S .
so after this RB JJ conversation , you might want VP ? &quot;
absolutely . RB , PRP VBP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
PRP MD VP .
PRP MD VP , and PRP VBP VP .
we have VP and we have VP , but when NP VP and NP VP , we &apos;re going VP .
i know SBAR , CC ADVP SBAR .
VBP NP .
VBP NP .
for some time i have been interested in the plac@@ e@@ bo effect , WDT VP . &quot;
in other words , sugar p@@ ills have a meas@@ ur@@ able effect in certain kinds of NNS , DT NN NN , RB because the person thinks that WHNP S VBZ NP -- for pain management , for example , if they believe it enough there is NP PP called the plac@@ e@@ bo effect .
NN JJ VBZ NP SBAR .
in NP PP S , i want VP .
and i &apos;m going VP . this is NP SBAR &apos;s magic book since QP NNS .
PRP VBD S PP .
NP VP , and ADVP NP VP .
and RB PRP VBP VP .
RB , RB VBZ SBAR .
NP , SBAR ; NP , SBAR .
PRP VBP ADVP VP .
PRP VBP VP .
and TO VP nothing goes RP CC RP NP SBAR .
that way NP VP can NN VB , RB RB as NP VP nothing can VB ADVP NP .
and NP PP VBZ ADJP .
PRP VBP VP , and RB , IN S , PRP$ JJ NN NN MD VP .
IN NP PRP VBZ VP , and DT NN VBZ RB VP .
NN VBZ ADVP NP-TMP . and PRP MD VP .
ta - da !
so , this is a trick that PRP RB VBP PP .
NP PP PP VB NP .
WHNP S VBZ NP .
PRP VBP NP .
i say S , that is a lie .
NP SBAR VBZ PP NP .
in a moment when NP PP VBZ ADVP VP , to a position poin@@ ting out like DT .
nice one .
NP SBAR VBZ ADVP ADVP .
RB , PRP VBZ PP INTJ .
and IN S .
and we could talk about why DT VBZ ADJP , SBAR . it groups them .
but DT VBZ RB SBAR . right ? and RB PRP VBP NP PRT .
obviously it &apos;s VP .
and then when PRP VBP NP , same thing , as PRP VBP ADVP , this motion kind of co@@ vers DT VBG ADVP IN NP .
PRP VBP NP ADVP . PRP VBP NP PRT .
RB VBZ NP . thanks .
RB , WP VBZ NP VP ?
PRP VP CC ADVP ADVP VP .
NP VP , so NP VP .
it turns out that if NP VP -- it &apos;s just a round white p@@ ill -- it has some certain meas@@ ur@@ able effect .
but if you VBP NP S , and VB NP PP , it is actually meas@@ ur@@ ably more effective .
RB IN S -- PRP VBP NP .
but DT JJ NN VBZ RB ADJP .
WP ? DT RB VBD NP PRT .
VBZ PRT SBAR .
IN S , PRP VBP ADJP .
DT JJ NN , WHNP S is ADJP PP .
NN VBZ NP .
CD NN PDT DT NN VBZ RB ADJP -- PRP VBP S . sorry .
but DT NN VBZ ...
... DT NNS VBP NP .
and DT NN VBZ NP .
and IN S , PRP VBP VP .
right ? DT NN IN NP , and PRP VBP NP PP ...
UH DT VBZ NP , it &apos;s ADJP PP .
PRP VBZ NP , DT NN , UH PRP VBP SBAR .
the point is DT JJ NN S .
and NN IN NP has DT JJ JJ NN , it &apos;s only your belief that VP .
PRP VBD S .
and VP CC VP .
and PRP VBP PP SBAR .
this is DT NML NN . PRP VBZ ADJP , and PRP VBP VP .
DT VBZ ADVP NP . DT VBZ RB NP .
DT VBZ NP ADVP . DT VBZ RB NP .
PRP VBP VP .
if PRP VBP ADJP -- if PRP VBP ADVP -- i was doing DT IN NP JJ NN , and some people WDT NP VP know , and CD NN almost passed RP .
so , i suggest if NP VP -- in fact , you know WP , NP VP .
NP VP , PRP MD VP .
so , here is WP VP .
PRP VBP ADJP , NP . am PRP VBG NP PRT ?
ok , and RB RB PP CC PP .
RB , RB PRP VBP PP .
sort of .
but NP VP MD NP ?
RB , VB S . NP VP , CD .
UH , UH ...
PRP VBP SBAR .
PRP VP , VP , he &apos;s ADVP RB FRAG .
RB , VB S .
WRB VP NP VP ? pretty good .
UH , PRP VBP .
CC NP VP , PRP VBP S . &quot;
NP PP VBP VP .
VB S .
DT RB VBZ NP . DT VBZ RB NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
PRP VBP ADJP . IN S , VP , VBP NP PP .
people in the back or people on video years from ADVP VP will go , &quot; well yeah , that looks kind of ne@@ at IN NP there , but if PRP VBD ADJP he would be -- VP &apos;s a hole there and a hole there , if it were real he would be ble@@ eding .
UH VB S .
UH , RB PRP VBZ .
RB RB , PRP MD VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
but i think PP CC PP , PRP VBP ADVP VP .
PRP MD VP .
PRP VBP S . VBP NP ADVP .
NN VBZ PP NP-TMP .
i had NP VP and they gave RP IN NP , and there were JJ JJR .
RB VBZ NP , PP .
RB VBZ NP .
NN MD VP .
but in NN IN NP , there are JJ JJ NNS WHNP S .
and PRP$ NN NN MD VP .
this app@@ lies to NP VP , and it app@@ lies to NP VP .
NP PP VBZ NP .
it turns out IN S , IN S .
i think EX VBZ NP , but by and large , this is NN WHNP S and we &apos;ll VP .
the second tra@@ p is DT NN IN NP ; basically , it &apos;s between VP .
and NP VP , and NP VP .
and DT JJ VBZ NP , and PRP VBZ NP SBAR - VBG IN ADJP NP .
NP VP , DT VBZ NP .
RB NP NP IN S .
now , i &apos;d like to start IN NP repor@@ ted a story , and that was a story -- he said NP VP , and it was ADJP NN and at DT JJ NN IN NP , there was a dre@@ ad@@ ful scre@@ ech@@ ing sound .
and RB PRP VBD , ADVP , SBAR .
but PRP VBD NP .
WHNP S VBD NP .
PRP VBD VP .
PRP VBD VP .
they coun@@ ted IN NP IN S ; DT NN VBD VP , and DT NN VBD RB SBAR .
WP NP VP , really , is IN S .
there is DT VP , but basically it has RB DT JJ .
it &apos;s DT NML NN does it hurt RB WHADVP S ? &quot;
and then there is a remem@@ ber@@ ing self , and the remem@@ ber@@ ing self is the one WDT VP , and it &apos;s NP SBAR , VBP SBARQ ? &quot;
S WRB VBD NP ? NN CC NN IN NP .
those are NP , NP CC NP , and VBG ADJP PP is NP PP .
RB , DT NN NN VBZ NP .
and NP ADVP VP -- NP VP .
PRP VBP SBAR .
PRP$ NN VBZ NP NP , that is , S .
and VB S .
DT VBZ NP .
DT VBP NP .
i won JJ NN VB PP . it &apos;s ADVP JJ DT NNS , but it was JJ WHADVP S .
PRP VBD VP .
ADVP VP , DT VBP NP .
and PRP VBP VP ? &quot;
and PRP VBZ NP .
clearly , patient b suff@@ ered RBR -- NP SBAR , and NP SBAR , and RBR .
but RB EX VBZ NP : FRAG ? &quot;
and RB VBZ DT NN .
DT NN VBZ SBAR .
NP PP VBD ADJP , and because NP PP VBZ SBAR .
CC NP VP -- but NP VP ...
but NP PP VBZ ADJP .
and NP SBAR VBZ NP ; PRP VBZ NP .
WRB VBP NP VP ?
because NP VP , and ADVP , ADVP , VP how bad was DT JJ NN , IN NP ? &quot;
and PRP VBD ADJP , PP .
RB DT VBZ NP .
IN NP , RB , NN VBD NP .
now , what you could do IN NP , and we actually ran JJ NNS , and PRP VBZ VP , and PRP VBZ VP -- you could actually ex@@ tend the col@@ on@@ o@@ scop@@ y of patient a by just keeping DT NN IN PP .
DT MD VP .
and if you do that for NP PP , you have made the experi@@ en@@ cing self of NN DT worse off , and you have the remem@@ ber@@ ing self of NP NP better off , because now you have VBN NP PP .
WP VP ?
and that is JJ PP WHNP S .
WHNP S VBP NP .
NNS VP CC VP .
RB , DT VBG NN VBZ NP ADVP .
PRP VBZ NP .
and PRP MD VP
CC NP VP : NP VP .
i mean , most of the moments of our life -- and i calcul@@ ated , you know , the psych@@ ological present is said to be QP NNS long ; that means that , you know , in a life there are NP PP ; in a month , there are about 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 -- most of them don &apos; t leave a tra@@ ce .
NP PP VBP ADVP VP .
and yet , RB PRP VBP NP SBAR .
PRP VBZ NP .
and WHADVP S PRP MD VP , but DT VBZ RB NP SBAR .
ADVP NP VP , and NP VP .
NP PP VBZ PP .
from the point of NN IN NP , if you have DT NN , and the second week is RB RB JJ PP , then the two - week vac@@ ation is twice as good as the CD HYPH NN vac@@ ation .
DT VBZ RB NP .
for DT NN NN , a CD HYPH NN vac@@ ation is ADJP PP IN S .
PRP VBP RB VP .
and in DT NN , time is RB NP SBAR ; time has ADJP NN IN NP .
RB , DT NN NN VBZ PP .
it is actually the one that makes NNS IN , S and is deci@@ ding which of them to choose , then the one that choo@@ ses is the one that has DT NN WHNP S , and that &apos;s the surge@@ on that will be VBN .
DT NML NN VBZ NP .
NP ADVP VP , PRP VBP PP .
and RB WHADVP S , PRP VBP NP ADVP PP .
PRP VBP PP .
and basically you can look IN NP , PRP VBP , PP , and PRP MD VP .
i have that sense that SBAR NP VP ; that is , NP VP , to DT ADJP NN , in NP PP .
and DT VBZ ADJP S .
S , WHADJP VBP NP VP ?
DT VBZ NP .
and when i think about DT , i think about a vac@@ ation NP VP , and i think of it relatively often , relative to WHADVP S .
and i probably have VBN NP PP PRN PP .
now , if NP VP , i would VB VP .
RB , NP VP , and NP VP .
RB VBZ S .
now , i may be a bit extreme , you know , in how little appe@@ ti@@ te NP VP , but SBAR , NP VP relative to DT NN WHNP S ?
RB PRP VBP S .
imagine that PP , NP VP , and NP VP .
RB , would PRP VB NP ?
and if you would choose a different vac@@ ation , there is a conflict between your two selves , and you need to think about WRB VP , and it &apos;s actually not at all obvious , because if you think IN NP , then you get one answer , and if PRP VBP PP , you might get DT NN .
WRB VBP NP VP we do S .
RB , DT CD NNS VBP PRT NP .
EX VBP ADVP NP .
RB PRP MD VP ?
and RB PRP MD VP ?
and PRP VBP NP .
WP VBP NP ?
and , by DT NN , now we are JJ PP .
IN S , PRP VBZ NP .
DT VBZ RB PP .
PRP VBZ PP .
RB JJ notion .
anyone WP VP is going IN NP IN NP , and i bel@@ ong to NP PP - being , who &apos;ve been mess@@ ing RP NP PP IN NP .
the distin@@ ction between NP PP has been VBN PP , and there are now eff@@ or@@ ts VP .
the gall@@ up organization has DT NN NN WHADVP S , and there have been NP PP .
RB PP , PRP VBP VP .
and DT JJ NN S VBZ SBAR .
you can VB SBAR , and that RB JJ &apos; t teach NP ADJP .
ADVP VP , DT NN VBZ PP .
what DT VBZ SBAR how much would you know IN NP ?
INTJ , NP VP , but NP VP .
PRP VBP NP .
if PRP VBP NP SBAR , you have DT NN IN NP .
RB DT NN VBZ ADJP .
PRP VBP NP PP .
NP VP , NNS VBP ADJP .
we know IN S .
NP VP , but NP VP .
RB if NP VP , you are VBG S .
DT JJ NN IN SBAR is IN S .
PRP VBZ NP .
now , very quickly , another reason NP VP about happiness is that NP VP , and we actually live .
so , if PRP VBP NP , you are not going VP .
WRB NP VP , you think S .
and what happens is SBAR , NP VP , and that NP VP .
well , it turns RP IN S and it &apos;s not RB RB JJ PP .
but now , because NP VP , PRP MD VP -- DT NNS MD VP .
and it &apos;s ADVP JJ VP .
UH , PRP$ VP VBZ RB VP .
PRP VBP SBAR .
but one thing will happen : they will think NP VP , and NP VP .
PRP VBZ ADJP S - VP , and NP VP .
VBP NP .
VBP NP . PRP VBP SBAR .
VBP NP ADVP .
now , when PRP VBD PP PP , you mentioned to PRP that NP VP .
is DT NP SBAR ?
NNP NNP : ADJP .
i think S .
PRP VBD ADVP PP .
WRB NP VP .
and it turns out that , below NP PP , for NNPS : S , like CD , so it &apos;s a large repres@@ ent@@ ative sam@@ ple -- below NP PP ...
6@@ 0,000 .
NN : CD .
NP VP , and NP VP .
IN NP , PRP VBP NP .
PRP VBP S .
clearly , what VBZ VP is NN S , but NN IN NP certainly bu@@ ys NP NP , and we can VB NP ADVP .
IN NP , PRP VBP NP .
NP SBAR , DT RBR JJ PRP VBP .
DT VBZ RB VP .
but NP , NP VBZ PP .
if NNS VBD ADVP SBAR we believe ADVP , PP , NP CC ADVP .
is there any chance that NP , SBAR , VP ?
NN : NP VP .
the recogni@@ tion is going VP , but in DT NN , it is VBG , and in JJ NNS it is VBG .
NNS VBP VP .
it &apos;s going VP , and people are going TO VP .
WRB VP goes ADJP NNS VBG PP or you think IN NP .
DT VBZ VP .
IN NP , NNS VBP VP .
DT VBZ VP , i think , IN NP , NP .
well , it seems to PRP that NP VP .
VBP NP ADVP PP .
VBP NP , NP .
PRP VBP NP . PRP VBP NP .
i &apos;ve been making NNS RB ADVP IN NP , and my goal for the next decade is to VB S .
now , i have NP PP , and it ent@@ a@@ ils VP , VP .
RB RB PRP VBP NP S .
NP PP MD VP .
RB ADJP NP-TMP , VBG SBAR . &quot;
but actually , according IN NP , it &apos;s ADVP NP VP .
QP NNS DT NN VBZ RB ADJP S .
in NN , i believe IN S .
PRP VBP VP .
so , that &apos;s probably a bit of a counter@@ intui@@ tive idea , so i &apos;ll say it again , let it sin@@ k in : if we want to solve problems like NP , NP , NP , NP , NP , i believe that we need to as@@ pi@@ re VP DT NN , IN NP .
no . PRP VBP ADJP . PRP VBP .
here &apos;s WRB . this picture pretty much su@@ ms up WRB NP VP . truly .
DT VBZ NP .
PRP VBD S , so PRP VBD PRT NP SBAR .
and DT VBZ NP .
RB , IN S , PRP MD VP .
you probably see NP PP , NP PP , but NP , NP .
if PRP VBP NP , you will notice NP ADVP : NP RP , and around the mouth is NP PP , and the e@@ ye@@ bro@@ ws up is NN .
DT VBZ NP .
UH , PRP VBP VP . UH , UH , RB PRP VBP NP .
an epi@@ c win is NP SBAR .
PRP VBD ADVP PP .
and WRB NP VP you are JJ S . that is DT JJ NN .
DT VBZ NP .
and this is the face that we need VP .
now , unfortunately this is NP PP .
this is WHNP S , and this is RB PRP VP . can you see ? yes . good .
DT VBZ ADVP NP S .
this is a piece of NP , SBAR .
and DT VBZ NP SBAR .
PRP VBP SBAR .
and PRP VBP NP S .
we do achieve RBR IN NP . but i also mean good as in NP , VP .
and when we &apos;re in NN NNS S , the RBS JJ S notice , the RBS JJ S takes , to get up after NN and try again .
and in JJ NN , WRB NP VP , WRB NP VP , we often don S .
S , S , S , ADVP ADJP .
NP ADVP VP , PRP RB VBP SBAR .
RB , DT VBZ SBAR .
WP about NP VP ?
WRB MD NP VP ?
RB , PRP VBD PP PP .
and PRP VBD S .
so , the first thing is WRB NP VP , there are lots and lots of JJ NNS WHNP S .
CC RB RB DT NN , it &apos;s NP SBAR . right ?
RB , PRP MD VP .
PRP RB VBP NP NP .
but it is on NP PP . so , you have VP , but there &apos;s NP PP .
ADVP VP NP , NP VP .
and EX VBP ADVP NP .
RB PRP VBP , S .
that &apos;s not NP SBAR .
and also there is NP , NP .
and RB PRP VBP NP .
PRP NNS VBP VP .
PRP VBP SBAR .
WRB NP VP i &apos;m not VBG S .
PRP VBP S .
now , the problem with collabor@@ ative online environments like NP PP is that it &apos;s RB JJ VP .
PRP VBZ ADJP .
so , so far , colle@@ c@@ tively PDT DT NN IN NP have VBN NP S .
RB , DT VBZ RB NP .
PRP MD VP .
but TO VP was WHADVP S .
DT VBD NP .
okay , so when we talk about WHNP S , the only way it makes sense TO ADVP VP is to talk about NN at NP , SBAR .
but it &apos;s RB ap@@ t . because PRP VBZ PRT SBAR , we &apos;re RB VBG SBAR .
PRP VBP VP .
DT VBZ ADJP . PRP VBP NP .
so , consider this really interesting stati@@ stic ; it was recently published by DT NN IN NP : the average young person today in a country with DT JJ NN NN will have spent 10,000 hours VBG NP PP .
RB CD NNS VBZ NP .
first of all , for NP VP you will spend in NP PP to NML NN if NP VP .
so , we have an entire par@@ alle@@ l track of NP VP .
and NP PP VBP ADVP VP . &quot;
RB , PRP MD VP .
it &apos;s based on NP SBAR .
PRP MD VP .
and so , now WP NP VP is NP PP .
so , S , VB SBARQ ? &quot;
IN IN S , PRP MD VP .
this is WHNP S .
DT VBP NP .
and in DT JJ NN we &apos;re VBG S .
IN S , DT VBZ VP .
the game industry is developing VP NP with NP PP so that NP , PP , VP .
PRP VBP NP .
PRP MD VP .
RB , PRP VBP VP .
RB VBP NP SBAR . DT JJ VBZ NP .
UH , VB PP .
ur@@ gent optimis@@ m is DT NN S .
gam@@ ers always believe SBAR , CC SBAR .
NNS VBP S .
NNS VBP NP .
there &apos;s a lot of JJ NN WHNP S .
and DT NN VBZ , SBAR .
we trust that NP VP , they &apos;ll stay with DT NN until NP VP .
and RB , VP VBZ PP .
and NP ADVP VP .
bli@@ ss@@ ful produ@@ c@@ tivity . PRP VBP NP .
PRP VBP ADVP &apos;s NP SBAR DT NN , NP PP .
it &apos;s because NP VP .
PRP VBP SBAR .
and NNS VBP ADJP , SBAR .
RB : JJ NN .
NNS VBP S .
so , just one bit of NP SBAR : so , you all know NNP , biggest wi@@ ki in DT NN .
NP PP , IN NP , VBZ NP .
QP NNS VBP NP NP-TMP .
they have VBN NP PP PP PP .
PRP VBP VP .
PRP VBP VP .
UH , RB DT VBP NP : NNS VBP NP .
DT VBP NP .
and the only problem is IN S .
DT VBZ NP .
RB VBZ NP NNP NNP .
his work is JJ . he looks IN SBAR .
and he says , IN S . &quot;
and PRP VBZ NP . RB , PRP VBZ ADJP .
and PRP VBZ ...
not VB NP : S .
but he says IN S .
they can VB NP SBAR ; they VBP NP and VB S SBAR .
so , he says IN S .
RB , PRP RB VBP SBAR .
but PRP VBZ RB , PP , NP .
PRP VBP S .
RB , PRP VBP NP PP .
DT VBP NP . right ?
IN S , PRP VBD NP .
and DT VBP NP .
and if PRP VBP ADJP , you might know NP , SBAR .
her@@ od@@ ot@@ us says IN S .
appar@@ ently , there was PDT DT JJ NN IN S .
NNS VBD VP . NNS VBD VP .
NP VP , PRP VBD NP .
so , according IN NP , they invented NNS NNS and they set RP ADJP NN : on CD NN , everybody would VB , and on DT JJ NN , everybody would VB NP .
and they would VB ADVP VP , and VB NP PP , they would ignor@@ e the fact that NP VP .
and ADVP IN NP , PRP MD VP ; and IN NP , PRP MD VP .
and according to NNP , they passed NP NP , VBG PP PP .
RB , DT VBZ ADVP , S , WHADVP S .
PRP VBP S .
we &apos;re VBG NP S , and we &apos;re VBG SBAR .
but PRP VBD SBAR .
DT VBZ ADJP .
according IN NP , IN NP NP VP , so DT NN VBD SBAR .
PRP VBD NP PP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
they would leave ly@@ dia , and they would go out in NP PP TO VP .
RB , DT VBZ ADJP ?
but recently , dna evidence has shown IN S .
and RB , RB , NNS VBP VP .
and ge@@ ologists have VBN NP .
RB , DT JJ NN MD VP .
they might have RB VBN NP PP , and RB VBN ADJP , and knew so much about WHADVP S .
UH , PRP MD VP .
PRP VBP VP .
DT VBD NP . DT VBD PP .
NP VP , PRP VBP VP .
PRP VBP SBAR .
now , they had PDT DT NN VB PRT PP , SBAR WRB NP VP .
let NP VP .
now , i know you &apos;re VP , &quot; WHADVP SQ ? &quot; well , that &apos;s what i have VBN NP PP , PP .
we have NP PP , and it expres@@ ses NP PP .
PRP VBP RB VP .
WHNP S VBZ VP .
PRP VBP S , and RB PRP VBP S .
PRP VBP S .
i &apos;m just going VP .
RB , DT VBZ NP .
PRP VBD NP PP .
DT VBZ NP .
the oil shor@@ tage is fic@@ tional , but we put enough online content out there for you to believe that it &apos;s real , and to live your real life as if we &apos;ve run out of oil . so when you come to the game , you sign up , you tell us where you live , and then we give you real - time news , videos , data fe@@ e@@ ds that show you exactly how much oil costs , what &apos;s not available , how food supply is being affected , how transpor@@ tation is being affected , if schools are closed , if there is ri@@ ot@@ ing , and you have to figure out how you would live your real life as if this were true . and then we ask you to blog about it , to post videos , to post photos .
PRP VBD NP PP PP , and PRP VBP SBAR .
and PRP MD VP .
nobody wants VP .
but if NP VP run IN IN NP .
DT VBZ NP .
VP , VP have VBN PRT NP .
so , for DT JJ NML NN , we decided VP .
PRP VBD NP .
and DT NN VBD NP .
DT NN VBD VP .
PRP VBD NP S .
you know jer@@ ry bru@@ ck@@ hei@@ mer movies , NP VP -- you &apos;ve SINV , and they all have NN S .
but in our game , instead of just having five people on the dream team , we said , &quot; everybody &apos;s on the dream team , and it &apos;s your job to inv@@ ent the future of NN , the future of NN , the future of NN , the future of NN and the future of DT JJ NN NN . &quot;
PRP VBD NP .
they came RP IN NP WHNP S .
so , finally , the last game , we &apos;re VP . this is NP VP .
if NP VP you will VB VP .
VP , and NP VP .
we &apos;ve S , we &apos;ve got NN RP IN NP .
i would like to invi@@ te NP PP VP .
RB , PRP VBP VP .
PRP VBP S .
WP VBP NP VP ?
we &apos;ve VP , we &apos;ve S , but none of PRP have saved DT JJ NN RB .
well i hope that NP VP .
we have PDT DT JJ NNS : NP , NP .
i really hope IN S .
and DT VBZ NP , SBAR .
when PRP VBP ADVP PP , i know two things for JJ : that NP VP , and we can play NP SBAR .
RB , PRP VBP : S .
VBP NP .
i &apos;d IN S .
i always keep PRP$ NN JJ WHADVP S , but i &apos;d already finished VP , and i realized that NP VP looked up the word &quot; dis@@ ab@@ led &quot; to VB SBAR .
VB S .
&quot; dis@@ ab@@ led , ad@@ je@@ ctive : cri@@ p@@ pl@@ ed , hel@@ pl@@ ess , JJ , VP , VP , VP , VP , VP , VP , VP , ADJP , ADJP , VBN HYPH RP , VBN HYPH RP , done - in cracked - up , counted - out ; see also hurt , us@@ eless and we@@ ak .
NNS , JJ , JJ , JJ . &quot;
i was reading this list out l@@ oud to a friend and at first was laugh@@ ing , it was so lu@@ di@@ cr@@ ous , but i &apos;d just gotten past &quot; man@@ gl@@ ed , &quot; and my voice broke , and i had to stop and collect myself from NP SBAR .
you know , RB RB , S ?
but , in fact , the print date was the early 198@@ 0s , WRB NP VP and as VP .
and , ADJP , VBP NP .
i mean , from this ent@@ ry , it would seem IN S .
so , i immediately went VP , VP .
RB VBZ NP .
RB , PRP VBZ RB ADJP .
i find NP PP , ADJP : NP ADJP . &quot;
RB , PRP VBZ NP PP .
PRP VBZ SBAR .
PRP VBZ PP .
PRP$ NN VBZ NP .
in fact , many ancient societies , including DT NNS and DT NNS , believed that IN ADJP DT NN RB VBD ADJP , SBAR .
so , what reality do PRP VBP S ?
by ADVP VP , we might VB VP .
JJ JJ NN NP VP ?
CD JJ NN WHNP S was PRP$ NN NN IN NP .
his name was NP , SBAR , so he went IN NP .
and NN NN RB VP CC VP .
i loved RB NN IN NP .
i had to do WHNP S , you know -- to help VP , and i hat@@ ed these b@@ ands more than NN -- i hat@@ ed them , had names for them . i hat@@ ed them .
and , you know , i was already bar@@ ga@@ ining , as DT ADJP NN , with NP SBAR .
and , one day , he came in IN NP and he said to PRP , &quot; wow . ai@@ mee , you are such a strong and powerful little girl , PRP VBP S .
WHADVP S , PRP VBP VP . &quot;
now , of course , this was a simple plo@@ y on dr. p &apos;s part to get me to VB NP SBAR .
and i have to wonder NN IN SBAR .
DT VBZ NP .
but , in the previous in@@ stances of DT NN NNS , our language isn &apos; t allo@@ wing us TO VP .
our NN NN &apos; t caught RP IN NP IN NP .
certainly , from a medical stand@@ point , my legs , las@@ er surgery for vision im@@ pa@@ ir@@ ment , ti@@ tan@@ ium k@@ ne@@ es and hi@@ p re@@ plac@@ ements for aging bodies that are allo@@ wing NNS VP , so they can go al@@ ig@@ n with global groups of their own choo@@ sing .
so , perhaps technology is reve@@ aling more clearly to PRP now WP VP : that NP VP , and that NP VP .
the human ability to ada@@ pt , it &apos;s an interesting thing , because people have contin@@ ually wanted TO VP , and i &apos;m going to make an ad@@ mission : this phr@@ ase never sat right with me , and i always felt un@@ easy trying VP questions about it , and i think i &apos;m starting to VB PRT FRAG .
impli@@ c@@ it in this phr@@ ase of &quot; over@@ coming ad@@ ver@@ sity &quot; is the idea that success , or happiness , is about VBG PP PP , as if NP PP VBP VP , or what other people percei@@ ve as my dis@@ ability .
but , in fact , we are changed . we are JJ PRN IN NP , whether ADVP , emotion@@ ally or both .
and PRP VBP VP .
NN NN JJ NN NP SBAR .
PRP VBZ NP .
and PRP VBP S .
RB PRP VP , ADVP VP , but PRP VBZ ADVP PP .
and , certainly , i &apos;m not VBG S .
there is ad@@ ver@@ sity and challenge in NN , and it &apos;s all very real and relative IN NP , but DT NN IN NP .
RB , PRP$ NN VBZ RB ADVP VP , but VBG NP S .
and we do DT NN IN NP WHADVP S .
there &apos;s DT JJ NN CC NN IN NP and DT JJ JJ NN IN SBAR .
and , tru@@ th@@ fully , the only NML CC ADJP dis@@ ability NP VP is DT NN ever thinking IN S .
in our desire to protect NP SBAR , or , RB , NP PP , we have to make sure that PRP VBP SBAR .
perhaps the exi@@ sting model of ADVP VP , ser@@ ves TO VP .
by not VBG NP , PP , we are creating DT JJ IN NP .
PRP VBP ADVP VP .
RB PRP VBP S .
and , RBS RB , EX VBZ NP .
so it &apos;s not about de@@ valu@@ ing , or ne@@ g@@ ating , ADJP S .
so maybe the idea i want VP there is not so much over@@ coming NN IN S , embra@@ cing PRP , gra@@ p@@ pl@@ ing IN NP , VP , maybe even dan@@ cing IN NP .
and , perhaps , if NP VP , we &apos;re NP VP .
this year we celebra@@ te DT JJ NN IN NP , and it was CD NNS IN PRN NP .
to par@@ ap@@ hr@@ ase : PRP VBZ NP , nor is PRP NP SBAR ; it is NP SBAR .
NN VBZ NP .
from darwin &apos;s work , am@@ on@@ gst NNS , NP VP .
RB , RB , NP , NP , VBZ NP .
and , RB , IN S , PRP VBP SBAR .
RB DT VBZ SBAR .
RB , PRP MD VP .
PRP MD VP .
RB PRP MD VP .
NN VBZ ADVP S .
PRP VBP NP .
RB , WP VP ?
RB NP NP .
there NNS JJ , there &apos;s typical . RB &apos;s no normal , and would you want VP ?
PRP VBP S .
if we can change this paradig@@ m from NP PP , to be RB DT JJ NN more dangerous -- we can rele@@ ase DT NN IN NP , and invi@@ te PRP TO VP .
anthropo@@ logi@@ sts tell us that NP VP .
there &apos;s evidence that NNS , NP IN , VBD NP PP , and perhaps it &apos;s because NP VP .
NP VP ; NP VP .
a few years ago , i was in NP PP WRB NP VP , and i was standing IN NP .
NP VP : NP VP .
i hear NP VP . &quot;
and NP VP , and NP VP . PRP VBP NP .
CC NP VP , have we met ? i don S . &quot;
NP VP , RB ADVP , NP VP .
PRP VBP , SBAR . &quot;
UH , DT NN .
and , CC IN NP , RB , PRP VBD VP .
this man was dr. ke@@ an , a man WDT NP VP .
and so my mother &apos;s pr@@ en@@ at@@ al physi@@ cian had VBN PP , SBAR .
and , because i was born IN NP , and had NNS VBD PRT , and DT JJ NNS IN NP in DT , he had to be DT NN -- this stran@@ ger had to be NP PP .
he said to me , &quot; i had TO VP , and you would never have the kind of NP CC NP , and you &apos;ve been making li@@ ar out IN NP ever since . &quot;
the extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved newspaper cli@@ pp@@ ings throughout PRP$ JJ NN , whether S , CC S .
and PRP VBD NP NP-TMP .
no pro@@ g@@ no@@ sis can VB PP .
and dr. ke@@ an went on to VB NP , he said , &quot; in PRP$ NN , IN S , and even if VBN NP , IN S , DT NN MD VP . &quot;
UH , NNP NNP VBD NP PP .
PRP VBD SBAR .
and there &apos;s been a shift in NP PP , in DT , IN S , IN S , PRP VBP SBAR .
PRP VBD PP ADVP ADVP .
but IN S , PRP VBP RB ADJP .
and it &apos;s IN S .
and perhaps this shift in me has happened IN S and cast sha@@ do@@ ws on PRP .
see , NP SBAR VBZ NP , and PRP VBP PRT .
if you can VB NP NP PP -- the human spirit is RB JJ -- if PRP MD VP , you are educ@@ ating them in the best sense .
PRP VBP S .
in NN , DT JJ NN IN NP educ@@ ate S . &quot;
PRP VBZ NP S . &quot;
RB RB , NP VBP NP VP ?
there was NP VP NN , WHADVP S .
PRP VBZ VP . PRP VBP S .
PRP VBZ S .
and NP NP VBP VP .
well , they took , over DT NML NN , NML NNS , gave them a &apos;s , told them PRP VBD VP , &quot; told them they were JJ , and at the end of this CD HYPH NN period , they were per@@ forming at a-@@ level .
and , of NN , DT ADJP , JJ NN IN NP , is IN S they were &quot; d &apos;s . &quot;
and DT VBZ SBAR .
NP SBAR , IN NP .
NP PP VBD SBAR .
DT NNS VBP SBAR .
they were simply told , VP , VP . &apos; &quot; and that &apos;s how PRP VBD S .
so , i think that the only true dis@@ ability is DT JJ NN , a spirit that &apos;s VBN VP have hope , it doesn &apos; t see NN , it no longer has our natural , child@@ like curi@@ osity and our in@@ na@@ te ability TO VP .
if instead , we can VB NP S , then we are truly using our power well .
WHADVP S , PRP VBP ADJP .
i &apos;d like to leave you with a po@@ em by a JJ HYPH NN per@@ si@@ an po@@ et named NN WHNP S , and the po@@ em is called &quot; the god who only knows CD NNS &quot; : &quot; DT NN has known NN , not NP PP , not the god of don &apos; ts , but the god who only knows CD NNS and kee@@ ps VP .
VP , VP . VP , VP . NNP NNP VBP NP .
WRB MD NP VP ?
suppose i said that , PP , NP VP .
or RB PRP VBP SBAR .
would PRP VB S ?
how about VP ?
or RB PRP VB NP .
WDT NP MD NP VP ?
WDT VP ?
creativity .
WHADJP NNS VP ?
VB NP . VB S .
DT JJ . RB RB RB JJ IN S .
DT NNS RB JJ .
WRB JJ MD VP ?
RB DT JJ JJR .
WRB IN NP ?
DT JJ JJR .
WP IN NP ?
UH , DT NN . DT VBZ S .
IN S , PRP MD VP .
is PRP RB JJ ?
CC VP ?
evolution has VBN NP ADVP PP , but i want VP .
the great 20th - century gene@@ tic@@ ist , t@@ .@@ g@@ . do@@ b@@ z@@ han@@ sky , who VBD ADVP NP , once wrote an es@@ say that PRP VBD SBAR . &quot;
now if you are one of those who does not VB NP , this would be a very good time to turn off your hearing aid , take out your personal communic@@ ations device -- PRP VBP NP NP -- and perhaps take NP PP VBZ NP PP , because nothing in the rest of this talk is going to make DT NN RB IN NP .
but if NP VP , consider DT : SQ , CC SQ ?
VBZ NP VP , or VBZ NP VP ?
DT VBZ NP .
in this picture , i &apos;ve put a bush with a center bran@@ ching RP IN NP , IN S : it has survi@@ ved ; it has demon@@ strated a fit@@ ness to its environment .
DT JJ NN IN NP , NN RP IN NP , is , of NN , DT NN WHNP S .
PRP VBP ADVP PP PP .
IN NP , EX VBP VP .
DT VBP VP .
PRP VBP VP .
it may seem IN S , but actually , for the most part , the basic machin@@ ery of PRP$ NNS is pretty much the same .
do you realize that NP VP ?
DT VBZ RB PP ; DT VBZ NP .
and speaking IN NP , do PRP VB SBAR ?
RB CD NNS JJR .
PRP VBP NP , SBAR , do PRP VB PP ?
PRP$ NN VBZ NP .
NP VP , NP VP , NP VP , NP VP .
and you &apos;re VBG S .
it &apos;s RB IN NP , IN NP .
but otherwise , you are NP PP , RB IN S .
NP VP , and NP VP .
but WP VP ?
are PRP IN NP ?
or VP : NP ?
now let &apos;s take a step back in time to the big bang , 14 billion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years -- the first sig@@ ns of proto - life , maybe three to four billion years ago on earth -- the first multi-@@ cell@@ ed organisms , perhaps RB JJ IN CD or DT CD years ago -- and then the human species , finally emerging in the last 13@@ 0,000 years .
in DT JJ JJ NN IN NP , life on NN is like DT JJ NN ; the animal king@@ dom , like a single measure ; and human life , a small gra@@ ce note .
DT VBD NP .
NP ADVP VP , so NP VP .
RB WHADVP S , PRP VBD NP .
PRP VBD VP .
i became en@@ am@@ or@@ ed of NP PP , and i realized something very fundamental : in most of NP PP , each cell simply divi@@ des , and all of DT JJ NN IN NP is car@@ ried on in DT NN NNS .
but IN NP , NNS VBP S .
JJ NN VBZ NP .
and ADVP , PP , NP PP VBZ ADJP .
in fact , you could say IN S .
now i have to conf@@ ess , when i was a college under@@ graduate , i thought , okay , NN HYPH NN , NN HYPH NN , death for sex -- it seemed pretty reas@@ on@@ able at the time , but with each pas@@ sing year , i &apos;ve come to VB NP .
i &apos;ve VB S .
and NP-TMP , NP VP .
PRP VBZ NP .
VBG SBAR .
PRP VP CC VP , SBAR . &quot;
VP , NN VBZ NP . &quot;
i came TO VP .
PRP VBD VP .
PRP VBD S .
PRP VBD S .
PRP VBD NP S .
evolution is RB RB VP , VP CC VP .
from an evolutionary point of NN , you and i are like DT NN NNS VBN S .
i think NP VP , &quot; NP VP .
PRP VBP S . &quot;
NN VBZ RB ADVP VP .
PRP VBD S .
NN VBZ NP PP .
DT VBZ NP .
at the bottom of the ocean , bacteria that VBP ADJP and MD VP , if fish were there , JJ HYPH NN VBN NP , ne@@ ver@@ th@@ eless , have managed to VB SBAR .
so what does this mean , IN S , and IN S , and ADVP IN S , i would say that there are NP PP .
DT JJ VBZ SBAR .
PRP VBP VP .
and the reas@@ oning behind DT would be , first , we have , IN NP , managed VP .
and secon@@ dly , PRP IN NP have RB VBN NP SBAR as well as we ada@@ pt IN NP .
and by DT NN , we im@@ migra@@ te and circu@@ late and VBP ADJP SBAR have NP SBAR .
a second possibility is IN S .
and DT NN RB MD VP .
and as far as isol@@ ation goes , when PRP IN NP do VB NP , there will be NP CC NP WHNP S .
but RB VBZ NP , NP .
i call PRP ADJP : NP IN NP as NP PP .
RB WRB MD NP VP ?
WRB MD NP VP ?
consider , RB , NP SBAR .
PRP VBP , PP , S .
PRP VBZ RB ADJP , but PRP VBZ SBAR .
think also , if it were JJ ADVP IN S .
what if PRP MD VP ?
JJ JJ NN NP VP ?
IN S , NP PP VBP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
PRP VBD NP .
the year after NP VP , you could VB NP PP .
today , you can have DT JJ NN IN NP .
PRP VBD NP VP , and PRP MD VP .
just a week ago , the national acade@@ my of engineering awar@@ ded its dra@@ per prize to fran@@ c@@ is ar@@ n@@ old and wil@@ lem ste@@ mmer , two scientists who indepen@@ d@@ ently developed techniques TO VP . &quot;
a couple of years ago , the las@@ ker prize was awar@@ ded to the scientist sh@@ in@@ ya y@@ am@@ an@@ ak@@ a for his research in WDT PRP VBD NP , and by mani@@ pul@@ ating just four genes , he in@@ duced that cell to rever@@ t to a plu@@ ri@@ potential stem cell -- a cell poten@@ tially capable of becoming NP PP .
DT NNS VBP VP .
the same technology WDT VP can make NP SBAR .
believe PRP or not , there &apos;s an experiment@@ al trial VBG PRT PP PP .
can PRP VB S ?
NP VP , and NP , VP .
VB ADVP NP .
you can VB NP PP , NAC ?
what if you could change NP CC NP , or change DT ADJP NN , and VB NP NP -- VB NP , VB NP , VB NP ?
WP VP ?
and then , that same analy@@ tic technology , DT JJ NN IN NP WDT VP , will also en@@ able PRP TO VP .
why not VB NP , SBAR ?
WRB RB VP ?
WRB RB ADVP ?
DT MD VP .
and when we are IN NP we want , PRP MD VP .
we &apos;ll VB NP , and we can VP : CC ADVP ADVP VP .
DT VBP NP .
will we use DT NNS VP ?
or , VP we sel@@ ec@@ tively choose NP SBAR ?
will PRP VB NP ?
DT VBP NP .
and most RB of DT , SQ need TO VP ?
IN ADJP , S , DT NNS MD VP .
VBP NP .
i want you now to VB NP .
PRP IN NP VBP NP .
these are nothing else than NP SBAR , and it will give PRP JJ NN , and it will RB VB NP , and it will VB NP , PP , S .
PRP VBZ ADVP NP .
but RB RB DT -- NP VP .
DT VBZ ADVP RB NP .
to show PRP RB WHNP S , that on average does carry RB CD lbs . on their bac@@ ks , and they are being asked VP .
obviously , DT VBZ VP -- RB NP , NP : NP .
so we thought S .
RB VB SBAR .
IN NP , PRP MD VP . RB JJ NN IN NP .
NP VP , VP CC NML NNS .
it senses WHNP S .
PRP VBP ADJP .
RB DT VBZ PP .
RB VB S .
EX VBP NP .
DT VBZ PP .
CC NP ADVP DT JJ NN .
we are talking here about , o@@ f@@ ten@@ times , ADJP NNS IN NP , that PP -- 20@@ s , 3@@ 0s , 4@@ 0s -- hit a wall and the wheel@@ chair &apos;s the only option .
but PRP VBZ ADVP NP .
and NP : SBAR : VBZ NP .
S , IN NP , PRP MD VP .
RB PRP VBD SBAR .
let me now introdu@@ ce NP VP .
VBP NP .
NNP VBZ VP .
PRP VBZ NP .
it &apos;s ADJP , NNS IN NP .
there are battery pac@@ ks here as well that NP VP .
i was ADJP CC PP .
IN NP , PRP VBD NP PP .
not RB RB , DT NN VBD PP , and PRP VBD , S . &quot;
and DT VBD PP .
PRP VBD NP PP .
adap@@ tive technology has IN VBD NP S .
but NN VBZ VP .
VBP NP .
as NP VP , NP VP , we have DT NNS S .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have all the potential here to VB NP .
thanks .
RB PP , PRP VBP NP .
WRB NP VP , i &apos;m VP .
now in PRP$ NN , where DT NNS VBP NP , you have TO VP .
PRP VBP NP .
PRP VBD NP , ADVP SBAR PRP VBD VP .
but still it was DT JJ NN IN NP VP .
when PRP VBD NP , he was having DT RB JJ NN IN NP .
here it was , the middle of DT NN , PRP VBD VP , under an um@@ br@@ ell@@ a , in her pa@@ jam@@ as , bar@@ e@@ foot , while PRP$ NN VBD PP .
the other volunte@@ er who VBD VP got to DT NN first and was asked VP .
the dog ! PRP VBD VP .
here was some law@@ yer or money man@@ ager who , for NP PP , gets VP .
UH , PRP VBD ADJP .
DT NN VBD NP PRT .
PRP VBD , S .
PRP VBP S , and PRP VBP S . &quot;
PRP VBP .
so , not exactly what i was hop@@ ing IN , but off PRP went -- up the sta@@ irs , down the hall , past the &apos; real &apos; fire@@ figh@@ ters , who were pretty much done VBG PRT NP PP , into DT NN NN S .
ADVP NP VP , but NP VP .
PRP VBD NP ADVP .
we took PRP$ NNS IN IN NP .
QP NNS later , the department received S .
NP NP VP : NP VP .
in both PRP$ NN IN NP and PRP$ NN IN NP , i am wit@@ ness to NP PP on DT JJ NN , but i &apos;m also wit@@ ness to NNS IN NP .
and PRP VBP SBAR ?
PRP RB VBP .
so as PRP VBP PP , i would offer DT NN : don &apos; t wait .
VP VBZ NP .
IN S , VB NP ADVP .
VB NP PP . VB PRT NP .
VB NP .
not every day is VBG S , but every day off@@ ers PRP DT NN S .
RB VB PP . VB NP .
VBP NP .
NP , NP , VB ADVP .
VBP NP .
PRP RB VBD ADVP PP .
it &apos;s NP , VP .
and UH , NP JJ NN VBG NP .
NNS CC NNS , VB NP .
DT VBZ NP .
NNS VBP , ADVP , NP .
that means PRP S .
RB , NNS VBP ADJP .
but unfortunately , we have VBN S PP .
but NNS VBP NP NP .
IN S , NN NN VBZ VP .
these guys have RB VBN NP ADVP , SBAR .
but RB , NNS VBP NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
the con@@ go is a parado@@ x -- DT NN IN NP , but also DT NN IN NP and cla@@ im@@ ed nearly as many lives as the first world war .
RB RB , DT NN RB VBZ NP .
bus@@ h@@ meat tra@@ des and forest loss means PRP NN JJ NN VP -- and we &apos;re not RB JJ PP VP .
RB , IN NP , PRP MD VP .
WP VBP NP ?
we know them as NP VP .
now , i &apos;m not saying S .
NNS , IN NP , NP SBAR .
NN VBZ RB ADVP NP .
IN NP , VB S .
PRP VBZ SBAR .
play incre@@ ases NN CC NN , and it &apos;s RB IN NP -- NP , NP , NP .
and WRB NP VP , you &apos;re VP .
NN VBZ NP .
RB , PRP VBP SBAR , but PRP VBP S .
RB , NP VP -- and NP VP .
RB RB , PRP VBP NP .
VB NP .
PRP MD VP . &quot;
ADVP NP VP , ADJP ?
yeah .
RB NN NN VBZ ADJP .
and this video is really interesting because it shows -- NP ADJP SBAR -- while at the same time being JJ NN .
but VP VBZ NP .
play &apos;s DT NN , and it can VB NP .
and PRP VBP S , DT VBZ NP , and PRP VBZ ADVP VP .
PRP VBP , IN NP , PRP RB VBP ADVP , and PRP VBP NP .
and it &apos;s that S , CC S .
RB DT VBP ADVP NP .
but they also hold DT NN IN NP .
DT NN VBZ SBAR .
IN NP , NN VBZ NP .
IN NP , PRP VBP S .
but will PRP VB NP ?
NN VBZ RB ADJP .
NN VBZ ADJP .
IN NP RB , NN VBZ RB ADJP .
in NP SBAR , it might VB NP .
and so , my fellow pri@@ mates , let PRP VP CC VP .
VBP NP .
i want PRP TO VP ?
RB NP VP .
now i don JJ NN VBP S , SBAR .
RB RB VB ADVP .
and in this scen@@ ari@@ o , i want TO VP .
and in DT JJ NN , the sper@@ m is VBG NP , S .
NP VP ; NP VP .
PRP VBP VP .
RB PRP VBP NP .
IN NP , PRP VBP NP .
i &apos;m a histor@@ ian by training , and what i study in NP VP -- meaning JJ NNS , NN NNS -- WRB NP VP ; how VBP they thought about bodies .
the other hat that PRP VBP VP is as an activ@@ ist , as NP : CC PRN NP : IN NP .
IN NP , WHNP S VBZ NP .
QP IN SBAR , is NP SBAR .
DT IN SBAR is NP SBAR .
and a lot of WHNP S is NNS WHNP S .
and IN NP , PRP MD VP .
NN VBZ PP .
i &apos;ll just VB NP NP .
so in one instance , you can have NN WHNP S , and that s@@ ry gene on the y chromo@@ some tells DT NN HYPH NNS , WHNP S , to VB NP .
and RB PP DT NNS VBP VP .
but IN S , DT NML JJ NN VBP PP .
and DT VBZ NP .
RB NP , but NP PP .
IN NP , DT NN VBZ NP .
WHADVP S , PRP VBZ PP .
PRP VBZ NP . PRP VBZ VP .
and it &apos;s often not until S CC S , that NN VBZ PP .
and they do DT NNS and figure RP IN , S .
RB WHNP S VBZ SBAR , but PRP VBP ADVP FRAG .
NP , PP , VBP PP VP .
PRP VBP PP .
and DT JJ NNS VBP NP .
most fe@@ males like me -- i believe PRP TO VP -- i don S CC S -- most NNS like me are actually androgen - ADJP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
the con@@ sequence is that NP VP .
so sex is really complicated ; it &apos;s not just NP VP -- in some ways , they can be RB PP .
another example : a few years ago i got DT NN IN NP , raised DT NN , had DT NN , had NP PP , had NP PP and had RB VBN PRT SBAR and a u@@ ter@@ us inside .
WHNP S VBD NP .
he had CD NNS , and in DT NN , his ad@@ ren@@ al gl@@ ands were IN NP IN S .
CC PP , NP VP , his brain was JJ PP .
and PRP VBD VP .
and it was only when PRP VBD VP that PRP VBD S .
UH , RB RB CD NP PP NP VP .
DT NNS WHNP S develop WHNP S .
and PRP VBP RB ADJP .
RB NN MD VP .
the reason that NNS IN NP -- whether S , CC S -- are often norm@@ alized IN NP is not because it actually leaves PRP JJR RP in NP PP .
IN NP , NNS VBP ADVP ADJP .
NP SBAR VBZ SBAR .
or system has VBN VP .
so we have the concept that WHNP S VBZ S ; what it means VP , alle@@ ge@@ dly , is to VB NP .
and RB PRP VBP NP .
and WRB NP VP , it star@@ tles PRP IN NP .
RB PRP VBP NP .
and PRP$ NN NNS RB VBD PP .
well NP VP it is WHADVP S .
where i ran IN NP the south african run@@ ner , ca@@ ster se@@ men@@ ya , had her sex called IN NP IN NP .
i had a lot of NP VP ? &quot;
and PRP VBD S .
in fact , we now know that sex is VBN ADVP SBAR ; we actually draw that line on nature .
so what we have is a sort of situation WRB ADVP , ADVP NP VP .
and PRP VBZ NP PP .
it &apos;s RB IN NP .
IN S , PRP VBP PP .
we look , IN NP , IN NP .
WP VBP NP S ?
and as we get RBR CC RBR IN NP , we get more and more into a dis@@ com@@ for@@ ted zone where PRP VBP S .
RB PRP VBP S .
one of DT NNS S , is bat@@ tles over NP CC NP .
we have difficult conver@@ sa@@ tions about IN WHNP NP VP , such that NP VP .
we have NP : RRC : IN NP .
in DT NN , our ancestors never had VP .
at most , they &apos;d VP .
IN S , PRP VBP NP .
but today , we have NP SBAR .
and as a con@@ sequence , we &apos;re stuck with VP , and this leads us to DT ADJP NN WHADVP S .
RB PRP MD VP .
PRP VBP NP , SBAR , but PRP VBP S .
NP SBAR VBZ S .
and PRP VBZ S .
so in NN S , i have TO ADVP VP .
NP VP , S , but NP VP .
i mean , they were RB JJ and RB JJ and RB JJ in WHNP S , and it &apos;s not because of DT NN , WHNP S .
PRP VBZ PP .
DT NN NNS VBD , PP , NP , and DT VBZ SBARQ .
WP NP VP VBD NP and VBD NP PP .
so as PRP DT VBP , WDT NP VP was NP PP , and the mon@@ arch@@ y was RB VBN PP .
NP PP VBP NP , but PRP VBD VP .
PRP VBD NP .
they had the idea that NP SBAR MD VP .
the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers re@@ je@@ cted DT NN , and PRP VBD NP PP , and DT NN VBD NP .
they VBD SBAR and VBD NP , and that was DT ADJP NN S .
now they were VBG NP PP SBAR .
CC NP VP , but NP VP .
and it &apos;s really clear , if NP VP , NP VP , and NP VP .
they were VBG ADVP PP , and they were VBG NP PP , SBAR .
PRP VBD VP .
and if NP VP , they talk IN NP .
PRP VBP NP PP .
PRP VBP S .
RB PP , PRP VBD VP .
and in VP , they were RB VBG PRT PP .
PRP VBP NP , but NP VP , and NP VP .
RB WP VP ?
what happened was women , for NN , WHNP S , VBD SBAR and VBD , &quot; the fact that we have a u@@ ter@@ us and o@@ var@@ ies is not significant enough in terms of a difference to mean that we shouldn JJ NN VBP NP . , etc . &quot;
and NNS RB VBD SBAR .
next came NP VP a woman ? &quot;
we find NP PP IN NP VBG , IN S . &quot;
again , NP PP VBG PP PP , RB , RB .
PRP VBP NP PP .
the problem is , of course , that , SBAR , NP VP .
ADVP VP , PRP VBP S .
IN NP , PRP VBP SBAR .
PRP VBP SBAR .
PRP VBP SBAR .
RB EX VBP NP .
but the challenge VBZ VP and VBP SBAR .
ADVP VP VBD PP .
NP VP , DT VBD PP PP .
let NP VP .
NP VP , so NP VP .
simply by NN IN NP that mary was VBN ADVP NP-TMP , she comes into all sorts of NNS three months earlier than NN S -- the JJ S sex , the right VP , the right VP .
henry has TO VP .
PRP VBP NP PP .
henry , by virtu@@ e of VBG VP is now li@@ able to be dra@@ f@@ ted , which mary does not need VP .
mary , mean@@ while , can not in NP VP .
NN MD VP , but NN MD ADVP VP .
RB PRP VBP NP .
and the question to me becomes : what do NP VP ?
i don S , but at DT JJ NN it kind of feels ADVP IN S .
RB WRB VBP NP VP ?
it seems like SBAR VP : VB ADVP , we have VP , so we will VB NP ADVP . &quot;
but NP PP VBP VP .
so for example , texas has at one point decided that WHNP S VBZ S .
RB IN NP PRP VBP SBAR .
but this is RB RB JJ , IN S .
if we look IN NP , he off@@ ers us something of NP PP .
he says S , but on NP PP , &quot; VP .
and PRP VBP S . &quot;
but IN FRAG , WRB VBP NP VP ?
WRB VBP NP VP ?
i also want to point out that NP VP .
i also want to VB SBAR some yellow lab@@ rad@@ ors WDT NP VP .
RB WRB VBP NP VP ?
PRP VBZ PRT S .
and part of PRP also wonder@@ s , WP if NP VP ?
do PRP ADVP VBP S ?
PRP VBP ADJP SBAR .
what PRP VBP VP is that NP VP .
PRP VBP VP , and PRP VBP SBAR .
we don &apos; t have DT NN WHNP S .
PRP VBP SBAR .
i &apos;m gla@@ d to say S .
but when i was on the phone with PRP , asking WRB NP VP -- this was a very high - risk surgery -- his answer was that , in this other nation , these children were going VP , and so he had TO VP .
NP PP VP , ADVP VP , have PRP VBN NP ? &quot;
the united states has off@@ ered JJ NN IN S .
RB PRP VBP SBAR .
UH , RB TO RB , PRP VBP S .
and i want VP , or might VB VP .
and i want to VB NP S , and that is that PRP VBP SBAR .
now IN NP , because NP VP , i &apos;ve RB VBN ADJP PP .
and one of NP SBAR is looking IN NP IN NP they think and operate in the world .
and what we know from JJ NNS is that NNS , PP , CC PP : are RBR JJ S .
and RB IN S , PRP VBP NP .
years ago , when i was IN NP , one of PRP$ NN NNS WHNP S asked a really strange question .
PRP VBD , S . &quot;
and PRP VBD , SBAR .
NN VP , ADVP VP . &quot;
but DT RBR S , DT JJR S might VB ADJP .
that is TO VP , there might be something , on NP PP .
so whereas the fa@@ thers were extremely atten@@ tive to VP , it &apos;s possible that if we inje@@ cted more mothers into this concept , WP NP VP , not just WRB VP , but WRB VP .
and maybe that &apos;s WRB NP VP , WRB NP VP , is VP .
so IN S , we &apos;re VP .
VBP NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
but before NP VP , i &apos;m VBG S , and that is , S .
i love NN , VP .
but PRP VBP S .
PRP VBP S .
NN , VBP NP .
JJ NN VBZ S .
i get TO VP ; my dollars usually go to DT JJ NN ; i look pretty unique ; and it makes NN IN NP .
S , WP VBP NP VP ?
is PRP VBG S ?
will PRP VB NP ?
will PRP VB PP ?
IN S , PRP VBP SBAR .
i want VP .
NP VP , WP VP ?
RB PRP VBP VP .
NP VP and NP VP .
RB NP PP VBZ NP .
i was VBG SBAR .
and since NP VP that means S .
and S PRP$ NN VBZ NP ADVP .
does DT VB ADJP ?
so as i do DT , i &apos;m also going TO VP .
RB VB S .
PRP VBP NP . &quot;
PRP VBP RB VP .
PRP MD ADVP VP .
DT JJ NN , VBG NP , cost PRP $ CD , and it was NP SBAR .
NNP : NP VP .
PRP VBZ ADJP .
IN S , PRP VBP VP .
NNP : S VP .
i &apos;ve VP .
RB VB SBAR .
if NP VP , NP VP , they will VB NP .
NNP : VP .
sometimes people tell PRP IN S .
NP VP , S VP . &quot;
NNP : NP VP .
IN S , PRP RB RB VBP .
and IN S , PRP VBP ADVP ADJP .
PRP VBD PRT PP .
but PRP VBD NP SBAR .
and PRP VBP VP .
if NP VP , there is DT NN IN S .
RB EX VBZ NP ADVP PP .
PRP MD VP .
VBP NP .
NP : NP : NP VP .
and finally , satur@@ day : VBG NP is DT ADJP NN S .
it &apos;s been VBN PP NP-TMP SBAR , and we &apos;ve VP .
RB RB DT VBZ RB NP .
ADVP IN S , PRP VBP VP .
IN NP PRP VBP VP .
i don &apos; t need VP .
VBP NP ADVP .
VBP NP .
JJ NN , NN .
PRP VBP SBAR .
VB PP .
DT VBZ SBAR .
VB S .
now if you take this picture -- i &apos;m itali@@ an origin@@ ally , and every boy in it@@ al@@ y gro@@ ws up with this picture on NP PP -- but the reason i &apos;m VP this is that NN RB JJ happened IN NP NP PP .
now some time ago , if you wanted VP , you take a budget , and you bet your budget on NP CC NP .
and IN S , RB PRP VBD VP .
now today , if you want to win the race , actually you need also something like this -- something that VBZ NP , has a few thousand sensor@@ s colle@@ cting information from the car , trans@@ mit@@ ting this information into the system , and then process@@ ing it and using it in order to VB ADVP PP and changing things in real time as NN VBZ VP .
DT VBZ SBAR .
and RB , PRP VBZ NP .
WHNP S VBZ SBAR .
NP , PP , RB VBP VP .
PRP VBP S .
and , as NNS IN NP , they &apos;re starting VP .
IN S , RB PRP VBZ NP .
just as an S , CC S &apos;s NN .
PRP VBP NP .
ADVP IN S , DT VBZ NP .
IN NP , NP PP VBZ VP .
NP PP VBZ VP .
PRP VBZ VP . &quot;
RB PRP$ NNS , PRP$ NN VBZ VP .
in DT JJ NN , it &apos;s RB IN IN S .
and DT VBZ ADVP VP .
IN NP , PRP VBZ ADVP SBAR ...
you know , when mich@@ el@@ angel@@ o sculp@@ ted the mo@@ ses , at NP , NP ? why don &apos; t PRP VBP ? &quot;
ADVP NN , IN NP , PRP$ NN VBZ VP .
and i &apos;ll NP : UCP .
VB NP PP .
well , DT JJ NN S is RB NP PP .
PRP VBD NP PP .
and what we did there was actually use a new type of NN at DT NN WHNP S and use anony@@ mous and ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ated information from that network , that NNS VBD ADVP PP , PP .
DT NN VBD NP .
PRP VBZ SBAR .
NP PP MD VP , it was NP VP .
and RB , NNP VBD PP .
RB VB PP .
RB PRP VBP NP .
PRP VBP NP PP .
PRP VBZ NP-TMP , PP .
PRP VBP NP .
JJ NN , NNS RB CC RB , VP CC VP .
DT NN VBZ -- NP .
NNP NNS . RB NNS .
NP , NP VP CC VP .
second half . NN IN NP .
ADVP ADVP , RB .
NN , NP PP .
RB NNS . yeah .
UH , DT NN , NN VBD S .
PRP VBD NP .
the following day , again everybody went IN NP VP .
and RB NN VBD ADVP .
you see DT NN IN NP , and you see the peak at NP PP .
well , that &apos;s RB CD NN IN SBAR .
NP PP : NP VP .
RB NN , PRP VBP NP PP .
this is NP SBAR .
but PRP VBP ADJP .
so IN NP , we actually developed DT JJ NNS VP .
so we actually started with a number of NNS WHNP S .
RB PRP VP CC ADVP VP .
RB VBP NP SBAR .
from NNP ...
after CD NN .
IN NP PRP VBD SBAR .
PRP MD ADVP VP .
DT NN VBD RB ADJP ADVP .
but RB VBZ NP .
but the other thing is that PRP VBP SBAR .
and DT NN NN S VBZ ADVP .
and IN S , RB PRP MD ADVP VP .
RB DT VBD NP .
my collea@@ gue at mit , as@@ sa@@ f bi@@ der@@ man , he could tell NP ADJP we discus@@ sed at the beginning , and that &apos;s actu@@ ating our environment .
and DT JJ NN VBZ NP .
it started with a question by DT NN IN NP .
CC NP VP : WHADVP SQ ?
and one of NP SBAR was , VB NP , and you &apos;ve VP .
PRP VBP PP PP .
IN S , S , PRP MD VP .
and RB PRP MD VP , and PRP MD VP .
UH , PRP VBD NP PP .
PRP VBD NP ADVP .
and PRP VBD NP S .
PRP VBD NP NP .
DT JJ NN VBZ VP .
RB NP NP , but WHADVP S , PRP MD VP .
DT NN RB VBZ VP .
and if NP VP , if NP VP , you can RB VB NP .
or you could close the building , and the whole architecture will disappe@@ ar , you know , these days , you always get images during the winter , when they take the roof down , of NP SBAR , &quot; PRP VBD NP . &quot;
UH , S , WHADVP S , DT NN RB VBZ .
RB VBZ NP VP .
PRP VBP SBAR .
and RB VBD NP NP DT NN .
UH , PRP MD VP .
but ADVP DT NN , PRP VBD ADVP NP .
PDT DT NNS IN NP came IN NP , IN S .
not anymore a building WDT VP would still make NNS CC NNS IN NP , and you had TO VP .
and that was , for us , VBD ADJP , SBAR .
but RB NN VBZ ADJP .
and DT VP CC VP .
here is DT NN RB IN NP .
and S PRP VBP SBAR .
DT NNS , VB S .
imagine you could VB NP .
RB VBZ NP .
RB VB NP PP .
RB PRP MD VP .
you can VB NP .
or IN JJ , but IN NP , WHADVP S , RB DT NNS VBP NP .
PRP MD VP .
VB S .
but then the whole thing can be NP PP .
RB is DT JJ NN NN CC VP .
WHADVP S , RB PRP VB NP . RB NP PP VBD ADVP .
and VB NP .
you can VB NP .
PRP VBP S .
we &apos;ve been working with NN NN , one of today &apos;s top bal@@ let dan@@ cers -- the é@@ toi@@ le at NP CC NP -- and actually cap@@ tured his movement in 3d in NN to use PRP IN NP .
and RB PRP MD VP .
PRP VBP PP .
PRP VBZ NP .
RB PRP MD VP .
PRP MD VP .
but then , once NP VP , then you can VP CC VP .
RB PRP VBP S .
PRP VBD S .
PRP VBZ NP .
PRP VBZ VP .
and the idea here is , VB , RB , PRP MD VP .
VB S .
and i think what VBZ ADJP SBAR .
DT VBZ VP .
now today , for the first time -- and the obama campaign showed PRP DT -- we can go from NP , PP , to DT JJ NN .
NP VP , PP , NP VP .
DT VBZ NP .
but tomorrow it can be , in order VP WRB NP VP .
so the idea IN S .
the cloud is a cloud , again , made IN NP , IN NP .
and DT NNS VBP NP .
PRP VP , CC VP .
NP VP , VBP NP PP .
you can actually see IN S .
so both NP PP and NN you can VB PP , PP .
PRP MD VP .
and a kind of NP PP .
VBP NP .
IN NP , NN VBZ ADJP .
through PRP$ NN i &apos;m VBG S .
PRP RB VBD PP PP , SBAR .
PRP VBD PP .
PRP$ NN VBD ADVP , my head was JJ , VP .
the ic@@ e@@ ber@@ gs around PRP were QP NNS out of DT NN , and i could only VB but VB SBAR , year after year .
NNS VBP VP .
DT NN VBZ NP .
PRP VBP NP .
some re@@ f@@ use TO VP , while NP VP .
it &apos;s easy TO VP , when PRP VBP PP , SBAR , that PRP VBP ADJP PP SBAR .
but DT NN VBZ ADVP .
IN S , PRP VBP VP .
IN S , PRP VBZ VP .
i approach VBG NP SBAR , VBG SBAR .
it is not DT NN WHADVP S ; it VBZ RB NP , but NP PP .
NP PP VBZ ADJP .
and NP PP VBZ ADJP .
DT JJ NNS S are IN NP .
PRP VBZ NP .
RB RB PRP VBZ .
PRP MD VP .
DT VBZ PP .
and i &apos;d SBAR CC SBAR .
PRP MD VP , PRP VBZ S , and DT NN VBZ VP , and the man is VBG ADVP .
DT VBZ NP .
PRP VBZ PP .
and DT NN VBZ NP .
and RB IN NP , DT NN VBZ NP NP .
VBP NP .
PRP VBP VP .
but ADJP VBD PP .
DT NN VBZ SBAR .
VP VBD NP .
and he VBD PRT PP and VBD , S . &quot;
and DT VBD NP .
ADVP VP VBZ ADVP ADJP .
PRP RB VBZ NP .
PRP VBD VP .
i have NP SBAR , so obviously gra@@ ff@@ iti is RB NP CC NP .
and RB PRP VBD SBAR .
so i VBD CC VBD PP and VBD , IN S .
WP VBP NP VP ? &quot;
and PRP$ NN VBD , SBAR .
i just want to VB ADJP and i said , &quot; VB NP ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; DT , unless S CC S , you can VB NP ADVP do that .
DT NNS VBN NP S . &quot;
CC NP VP , ADVP ADVP , WHADVP SQ ? &quot;
has NN VBN SBAR ? &quot;
NP VP -- ADVP VP .
PRP VP , NP . WRB MD NP VP ? &quot;
so i showed RP IN NP VP , and instead , i wrote NP SBAR .
i commit@@ ted to his brother and his father right then and there -- i &apos;m like , &quot; all right , here &apos;s the deal : JJ NNS VBG S , we &apos;re VBG S , and we &apos;re VBG S .
because PRP VBZ NP SBAR . &quot;
RB PRP VBD PP PP .
i met these guys called NP , NP , and they have DT NN WHNP S , and it just regi@@ sters the negative space .
RB PRP VP CC VP .
NP SBAR , PRP VBD SBAR .
first it starts IN NP , then it starts IN NP , then it was NN NNS and then people actually got IN NP .
but EX VBD ADVP NP .
so i went home and was having dinner with my wife and was telling her about this , and we were like , &quot; well wait a second . if we know that this technology exists where you can VB NP S , why don &apos; t we figure out a way for VP and he could do gra@@ f again ? well that would be a@@ wes@@ ome . &quot;
RB IN S .
CC RB two years later , about DT NN later , after NP PP and NP PP , we &apos;d ac@@ compli@@ shed QP NNS .
one , we bat@@ ter@@ ed RP NP PP , and we actually got VB NP .
WDT VP .
and he &apos;s seriously one of the fun@@ ni@@ est -- i call NP NP , IN S , you get DT NN IN NP , and you &apos;re UH , IN S . this guy &apos;s so amazing . &quot;
the other thing NP VP is NP VP .
PRP$ NN CC NNS and PRP moved IN NP , and DT NNS CC NNS and NN NNS CC NNS took RP PRP$ NN .
a lot of PRP$ NNS thought S and IN S and all the pictures on DT NN would be VP CC VP .
but IN PP , PRP VBD , PRP VBD PP , PRP$ NNS VBD VP , PRP$ NN VBD VBN , and we created DT .
NP VP , and NP VP .
this is DT JJ NN IN NP .
we took a p@@ s@@ 3 camera , ha@@ cked PRP JJ , moun@@ ted it to DT ADJP NN , and now there &apos;s DT NN WHNP S -- you build this yourself , we publi@@ sh the code for free , you down@@ load the software for free .
and RB PRP VBP VP .
RB NP SBAR . &quot;
RB NP SBAR . &quot;
NP SBAR RB VBZ NP .
VBP NP .
VBP NP NP ADVP . DT VBD ADJP .
RB PP , PRP VBD ADVP S .

and after over NP PP , NP PP , NN and NML NNS , NP VP .
and this is DT JJ NN , IN S .
PRP VBD NP SBAR .
and PRP VBD PRT NP PP PRT PP .
and he dre@@ w RB IN NP , IN NP -- and you can RB VB SBAR .
the funny thing was , PRP VBD S , so we totally felt IN S .
so at DT NN IN NP , he sent us an email , and this is WP NP VP : VB S .
PRP VBP SBAR , and NP ADVP VP so NP VP . &quot;
NP SBAR JJ ?
RB IN NP ADVP .
DT VBZ SBAR .
and PRP VBP SBAR .
NP VP , but NP VP .
and NP SBAR VBZ ADVP ADVP .
so we &apos;re IN NP .
IN NP , PRP VBP SBAR .
PRP VBP SBAR .
S , NP VP ; NP VP .
PRP VBZ NP .
RB DT NNS VBD SBAR . &quot;
arm@@ strong VBN PP , time magazine hon@@ or@@ ed us as NP , SBAR .
the cool@@ est thing about this -- and this is what VBZ S -- is that in NNP IN NP , at DT NN NN IN NP , there &apos;s VBG S . &quot;
and &quot; art of the streets &quot; is going TO VP .
VB NP .
ADVP ADVP NP VP : SBAR , VP .
NN IN NP JJ NN possible -- this stage , this computer , this mic , the e@@ ye@@ writer -- wasn &apos; t possible IN NP .
VB S , NP-TMP .
i &apos;m not NP , RRC , but i just VBD NP and VBN NP PP SBAR .
and this is DT NN S you feel that needs to VB VP : SBAR , WHADVP ? and if not me , then who ?
VBP NP NP .
you know , WDT NP VP is NP PP , and i &apos;m NP NP , IN NP .
and PRP RB VBP NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
PRP VBP ADVP NP-TMP S .
and PRP VBP , SBAR .
PRP VBP ADVP VP .
DT VBZ NP .
NP PP VBD NP .
PRP VBZ ADVP NP .
my circle began RB PP IN NP WHADVP S .
i was NP VP .
PRP VBD NP PP .
PRP VBD NP PP .
PRP VBD NP PP .
and PRP VBD S .
i had a th@@ um@@ b , i had 85 dollars , and i ended up in NP , NP -- met a lo@@ ver -- and back IN NP , found PRP JJ S .
about three or four years ago , i got a phone call in NP PP from NP , NP , WHNP S , &quot; PRP VBP S .
PRP VBP ADJP SBAR .
could you please come PP , CC S .
and i should VB SBAR . &quot;
UH , DT JJ NN PRP VBD PP .
PRP VBD NP PP , PRP VBD , PRP VBD , and PRP VBD SBAR .
we found PRP$ CD , we got PRP$ RB , and we VBD NP and VBD PP , IN S .
PRP VBZ NP .
and just as NP SBAR VBD S , she turned IN NP and was VBN PP .
and WP VP , it had VBN NP : FRAG .
DT NN VBZ SBAR .
PRP VBD SBAR .
and PRP VBP , SBAR .
NP VP , and NP VP .
PRP RB VBZ -- NP VP , and NP VP .
VBP NP .
VB NP SBAR .
VB NP .
VB NP .
PRP VBZ ADJP .
UH PRP VBD NP . PRP VBD VP .
PRP VBD NP .
RB PRP VBD PP ADVP , and PRP VBD , PP . we probably hit DT NNS . &quot;
NP VP , and NP VP .
PRP MD VP .
NP RB , CD NNS VBD PP .
DT NN NNS IN NP PP .
DT NNS RB RB DT NN .
PRP VBZ PRT NP .
RB VB S .
and RB PRP VBZ NP .
NP VP , ADVP VP . &quot;
PRP VBP SBAR .
NP VP , PRP VBD NP . NN VBD ADVP .
RB PRP VBP S .
PRP VBD SBAR .
we have this bu@@ cket list , we have these things we want VP , and i thought about all the people PRP VBD S , all the f@@ ences NP VP , all the experiences NP VP and i never did .
as NP VP , i came RP IN NP . &quot;
IN IN S , PRP VBP S .
PRP RB RBR VB S .
and NP , SBAR , VBZ ADVP VP .
the second thing NP VP -- and NP VP -- NP VP , wow , i really feel one real re@@ gre@@ t .
PRP VBP SBAR .
IN NP , PRP VBP VP .
but IN NP , PRP RB VBP NP S .
and PRP VBD NP-TMP SBAR .
and PRP VBD PP PP , PP , PP .
and RB , IN S , PRP VBD S .
NP VP , but NP VP .
PRP VBP RB VP .
PRP VBZ ADJP .
NP ADVP VP ; NP VP .
DT JJ NN S , &quot; CD , CD , CD . &quot;
PRP MD VP .
PRP VBP S . &quot;
PRP VBP SBAR .
and IN S , PRP VBD NP .
PRP VBZ SBAR .
but PRP VBD ADJP .
NP VP ; NP VP .
and DT NN RB VBN PP .
PRP RB VBP SBAR .
IN NP RB , i was IN NP -- NP , RB NP ...
NFP ADVP .
and PRP VBP VP .
and PRP VBD NP PP PP .
i realized at DT NN , by VP , that NP VP .
RB DT , RB NP , NP VBZ S .
PRP VBD VP .
i was VBN NP .
PRP VBP S , and how would you change ?
what would PRP VB VP ?
WRB MD NP VP ?
NP IN NP , are PRP VBG NP ?
VBP NP .
NP PP VBZ ADVP ADJP .
PRP VBP SBAR .
NP PP VBZ NP .
NP SBAR , DT VBP NP .
now if PRP VBP S , we can actually cause NP PP IN NP .
NP VP ; NP VP .
but if PRP VBP S , then we are in NN .
and DT VBZ NP .
RB PRP VBP PP .
DT NN VBZ PP , and DT JJ JJ NN VBZ VP .
NP RB , UH ?
PRP VBP S .
WRB NP VP , it was RB JJ WHNP S .
DT JJ NN WHNP S is PRP &apos;s very , very complex on DT NNS part , DT NN NN , VBN NP .
and PRP VBD S .
so IN S , and PRP VBD NP SBAR .
and RB DT ADJP NNS VBD .
NN VBD SBAR , but NN JJ NN VBP S .
NN JJ NN VBP NP PP .
and after NP VP , i realized , INTJ , NP VP .
PRP VBZ ADJP .
the dro@@ pp@@ er is pro@@ w@@ ling ac@@ tively on DT JJ NN IN S , and RB IN S .
and SBAR , NP VP .
so that really got my attention , and we started VP , IN S , &quot; well , we don S .
it could VP , VP .
RB NP ADVP VP . &quot;
so we extra@@ cted and de@@ comp@@ iled DT NN NN , and we discovered IN S .
and PRP RB VBD SBAR .
PRP VBD NP SBAR .
PRP RB ADVP VB NP .
RB PRP VBP NP .
and if NP VP , let NP VP : the pay@@ load is NN NN .
PRP VBZ NP PP .
RB PRP VBP NP .
PRP VBP VP .
VBZ ADVP PP .
and PRP VBP S .
so WP NP VP , system function calls , IN S .
and then we were VP CC VP .
RB PRP VBP VP .
in order to VB NP , we remember that PRP VBZ NP , PRP MD VP and PRP VBZ ADJP .
RB PRP VBP SBAR .
PRP RB VBZ PRT PP .
so i told PRP$ NN , NP VP . &quot;
and i VBD NP PRT and VBD NP PP S .
and DT VBD ADVP .
RB PRP VBD ADJP .
DT NN VBZ SBAR .
and if NP VP , you are RB JJ S .
what we also saw is that DT NN IN NP was RB VP .
the big digital war@@ head -- PRP VBD NP PP .
ADVP , NP ADVP VP ; NP VP .
i started VP and found S , and each cas@@ ca@@ de hol@@ ds 16@@ 4 cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ges .
IN S , DT VBD NP .
and PRP RB VBD ADJP .
NP PP VBP VP .
and S PRP VBD PP ?
an RB JJ structure .
RB RB , DT VBD NP .
and DT VBD NP NP .
ADVP VP , PRP VBD S .
DT NNS VBP VP .
and PRP RB VP CC VP .
anyway , so we figured RP IN S .
the small war@@ head is VP , CC VP CC VP , and the big war@@ head is VP CC VP .
RB RB RB , PRP VBP ADJP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
RB PRP VBP SBAR .
RB &apos;s NP SBAR -- RB VBD NP ADVP .
ADVP NP VP , and PP NP VP .
now what this thing does is it inter@@ cep@@ ts the input values from NP PP -- and it provi@@ des legi@@ ti@@ mate program code , WDT VP .
and IN NP , DT JJ NN NNS VBZ ADVP VP .
so it &apos;s ADVP IN IN NP .
DT VBZ S , INTJ ?
DT NN RB VBZ ADVP RB ADVP .
PRP RB VBZ ADJP .
DT NN VBZ S .
PRP VBP NP SBAR .
so for NN , in a power plant , when PRP$ JJ NML VBZ ADJP , you must open NN NNS IN NP .
RB , DT MD RB VP .
RB DT VBZ SBAR .
and WHADVP S , RB ADJP NNS MD VP .
PRP$ NN MD VP .
and CC NP CC NP MD VP .
DT VBZ ADJP .
but PRP VBZ ADJP .
and DT VBZ ADJP , SBAR .
VP : NP VP .
PRP VBD SBAR .
RB PRP MD VP .
PRP VBZ ADJP .
and you don S -- as an attac@@ ker -- you don NP VP .
PRP MD ADVP VP .
RB VB NP PP .
and IN S VBZ NP .
DT VBZ NP .
RB RB , NP PP VBP RB PP .
PRP VBP PP .
ADVP NP , DT VBP NP .
NP VP , and NP ADVP VP .
thanks .
PRP VBP SBAR .
NN , PRP VBZ VP .
is DT PRP$ NN ?
UH , PRP RB VBP S ?
yeah . okay .
PRP$ NN VBZ SBAR .
RB NP PP VBZ NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
IN ADVP , PRP$ NNS MD ADVP VP .
VBP NP PP . VBP NP , NP .
i have VBN NP-TMP S .
PRP VBD PP .
PRP VBD PP .
PRP VBN PP .
and i spent 30 days VBG NP PP .
in fact , most of my career , i &apos;ve been immer@@ sing myself into ADJP NNS IN NP , WDT VP .
so when i knew S , i knew PRP MD VP .
so IN S , DT NN NNS ago , i took RP NP PP .
i sent RP NP , NP , and i gave NNS DT NN S .
that &apos;s right , some lucky individual , corpo@@ ration , for - profit or non-@@ profit , was going to get the RB HYPH RB - a-lifetime opportunity -- because PRP VBP ADJP -- to buy the nam@@ ing rights to NP SBAR , that at the time didn &apos; t have a ti@@ tle , didn &apos; t really have a lot of content and didn &apos; t really give much hin@@ t as to what the subject matter would actually be .
so what you were getting was this : your name here pres@@ ents : my ted talk that PRP VBP NP and , depen@@ ding on the content , could ultimately b@@ low up in your face , especially if i make you or your company look stupid for VP .
but DT NN VBD , SBAR .
PRP VBP SBAR ?
PRP VBZ NP .
DT VBZ NP .
ADVP PP , PRP VBD SBAR .
RB if NP VP have VBN NP SBAR .
but in NP SBAR , we exam@@ ine NP PP .
and as i said RBR , i put myself in some pretty horri@@ ble situations over the years , but nothing could pre@@ p@@ are me , NP VP me , for NP PP .
NP VP , PRP VBD NP .
what PRP VBP S is make DT NN RB PP .
RB DT NN MD VP . &quot;
so what happens in &quot; the greatest movie RB sold , &quot; is that everything from NP PP , from NP PP , is brand@@ ed IN S .
RB NP , NP , NP ...
DT NNS MD VP .
and RB DT NN VBZ NP in NP , ADVP ?
PRP VBP NP .
DT VBD ADJP .
PRP VP , NP . forever . &quot;
but not only are PRP VBG S , but we &apos;re VBG S .
ADVP NP VP and NP VP ...
the greatest car NP ADVP VP , &quot; DT JJS NN S DT JJS NN RB VBN . &quot;
RB DT NN VP , PP , but RB VB S ?
and RB PRP VBP NP .
NP PP VBZ NP .
PRP VBP VP .
so DT VBZ S .
and PRP MD VP .
you know S .
PRP VBP SBAR .
do you have a perspective -- PRP VBP SBAR ?
WHADJP NN VBZ NP VP ?
CD CD .
i think IN S , but i think S .
WP VP , we look IN NP .
WP VBP NP VP ?
DT NNS RB MD VP . &quot;
but is PRP NP PP PP ?
NNP : DT .
... VP RB RB JJ .
RB , NN , can PRP VB NP ? PRP MD VP .
PRP MD VP .
okay .
a@@ wes@@ ome .
PRP VBP VP .
yeah .
SBAR NP VP . .
PRP VBP SBAR .
VB NP PRT .
NP VP , NN VBD SBAR . &quot;
VBZ PRT SBAR . &quot;
and RB IN NP , NP PP RB VBD .
NP PP VBD NP S .
PRP VBD ADJP .
PRP VBD NP S .
and i was blo@@ wn away , because PRP VBD SBAR , to VB NP S .
especially in today &apos;s world , this inter@@ section of NP CC NP and the VBN NP &apos; t the idea VP ?
UH , DT VBZ SBAR .
but the problem was , S , SBAR , CC SBAR .
ADVP NP , DT VBD RB NP .
DT NN JJ NN VBP VP .
DT MD VP .
but WHNP S VBD NP .
see , WRB NP VP , NP VP -@@ -- this is NP PP .
RB PRP IN NP PRP VBP , NP . no .
this is was NP : S .
NP VP , PRP VBP NP .
NP VP , NP VP , ADVP NP VP .
but RB WHADVP S , NN RB VBZ .
but WRB ? UH , NN VBZ ADJP .
PRP VBZ NP : PP .
and PRP VBZ ADVP ADJP .
WP RB VBZ ADJP ?
VBG NP .
DT NNS RB JJ .
now when PRP VBD S , &quot; no , we want PRP TO VP .
NP VP , but NP ADVP VP . &quot;
see , when i was a kid and my father would VB NP PP -- and there he is VBG NP NP -- he would VB , &quot; son , there &apos;s three sides to every story .
ADVP VP , EX VP CC ADVP VP . &quot;
RB PRP VBP , PP , SBAR .
but with only one company , one agen@@ cy willing to help me -- and that &apos;s only because i knew NNP NN and NNP NNP for NNS -- i realized that i would have VP , i &apos;d have TO VP .
so what you suddenly started VP -- or WP NP VP -- is IN S .
PRP VBP NP , and PRP VBP NP .
and the friends of NP SBAR is because of NP SBAR .
and then my friends WP VP , &quot; well , WRB VBP NP VP ? &quot;
and DT NN VBZ VP . &quot;
RB WHADVP ADVP MD NP VP ?
DT NN PRP VBP ADJP , DT NN PRP VBP PRT NP , PRP MD VP .
while any@@ time NP VP , NP VP , NN are PRP JJ RB IN NP ?
are PRP JJ ? PRP VBP ADJP .
PRP VBP S .

whether NP VP have PRP$ NN .
we will VB S .

RB VBD NP .
DT JJ NN S was DT NN IN S -- the mor@@ gan sp@@ ur@@ lock brand is DT NML NN .
DT VBP VP .
and PRP VBP ADVP NP-TMP .
and i think S .
most companies tend to -- CC NP VP , and you really embra@@ ce those , and you actually turn them into NP PP , and it &apos;s a ne@@ at thing TO VP .
NP VBP PP ?
NP PP VBZ NP .
and PRP MD VP .
now RB VBZ JJ NNS and JJ NP , NP , but a JJ , JJ brand is DT ADJP NN .
a JJ , JJ brand . WP VBZ NP ?
IN S , PRP$ NN NN , WP MD NP VP ?
are PRP DT NP NN ? are PRP NP SBAR ?
or are PRP ADJP PP ?
are PRP NP SBAR ?
up at@@ tribu@@ tes are things like VP .
or are PRP ADJP PP ?
are PRP ADJP PP ?
are PRP VP , VP ?
are you JJ , JJ , JJ , JJ , JJ , JJ , JJ CC JJ IN NP ?
over DT NN IN NP , we had NML NNS WHNP S .
they wanted NN VP , ADVP IN S , they would have NP PP .
but we did get 17 brand part@@ ners who VBD ADJP and who RB VBD NP S .
they en@@ ab@@ led us to tell DT NN IN NP , as we got IN S .
PRP VBD PP SBAR .
in NP PP , there &apos;s DT NNS , there &apos;s DT NNS , there &apos;s NP , NP .
and PRP VBD PP SBAR .
what VBZ ADJP SBAR had the most NN in , are ones where PRP VBP VP .
and DT VBZ SBAR .
they cut RP DT NN , they VBD PRT NP and VBD , NN RB DT NNS don S .
PRP VBP VP .
i &apos;m going TO VP . &quot;
and WRB VBZ NP VP ? has PRP VBN ADJP ?
UH , IN S , VB S .
according to bur@@ r@@ elles , the movie pre@@ mi@@ ered IN NP , and IN ADVP -- and this isn &apos; t even the whole thing -- NP VP had QP NNS NNS IN NP .
DT NNS RB VBG ADVP PP .
NP VP -- NP , NP .
NP NP even VBN VP .
PRP VBZ RB ADJP . PRP VBZ S .
PRP VBZ NP .
RB RB , DT NN VBZ ADVP VP .
and RB JJ IN NP .
WP NP ADVP VP is IN IN S .
PRP VBP SBAR .
i believe IN S .
PRP VBP SBAR .
PRP VBP S .
RB , VP , PRP VBP SBAR .
PRP VBP SBAR .
embra@@ ce fear . embra@@ ce risk .
NP PP , PRP VBP S .
and RB , PRP VBP S .
NN , ADJP PP , DT JJ NN VBZ VP .
and that being said , through hon@@ est@@ y and transpar@@ ency , my entire talk , &quot; embra@@ ce transpar@@ ency , &quot; has been brought IN NP IN NP IN NP , who for $ 7@@ ,@@ 100 bought DT NN NNS IN NP .
turning JJ NNS IN NP IN NP .
NP VP : JJ NN NN . &quot;
VBP NP ADVP , NP .
RB , NP , PP , WHNP SQ ?
DT VBZ NP .
i have in PRP$ NN DT NN S -- a check for $ CD TO VP ted .
PRP$ NN VBZ ADJP .
and 18 months ago , i had DT NN IN NP , and i pit@@ ched NP PP , and she allowed PRP VP .
and PRP VBD NP-TMP .
DT NN IN NP , i can VB NP , PP .
but PRP VBP VP .
EX VBP NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
and PRP VBD PRT PP .
i had DT JJ NN -- i &apos;m not VBG -- but i didn S .
and RB WHADVP S , PRP VBD S .
and while VP , i tried VP .
ADVP NP VP , and NP VP .
i &apos;m VBG S .
ADVP , ADJP : NP VP .
PRP VBP ADVP PP ADVP .
PRP VBP SBAR , you &apos;ve S .
i &apos;m VBG S .
NP .
VP , PRP VBP PP .
NP VP , PRP VBD NP ADVP .
NP VP , PRP VBP NP .
PRP VBP S ?
VB NP PRT , CC , PP .
NP VP , PRP VBP S .
VB S . VB NP .
VB .
thanks . LS NP SBAR .
so now i &apos;m IN NP , VP IN NP .
PRP VBP NP .
IN S , PRP VB PP .
RB DT VBZ NP .
RB DT VBZ NP .
for NP SBAR , you can VB NP -- but i &apos;m VBG S .
and DT VBZ NP .
ADVP NP VP , PRP VBP , NP .
and i get NP PP VP : S SBARQ &quot;
RB PRP VBP VP .
PRP MD VP .
PRP VBP NP .
NP VP ; NP VP .
but RB PRP RB VBP S .
and ADVP NP VP , and NP VP .
and PRP VBD INTJ , PP . DT VBZ ADJP . &quot;
VP , and NP VP .
i did a little research , spoke to DT NN IN NP at the S , CC ADVP S squ@@ all , which invol@@ ves VP .
and RB PRP VBD ADJP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
ADVP SBAR , PRP MD ADVP VP .
RB RB S , i &apos;m VBG S .
NP VP , and NP VP .
DT JJS VBZ ADVP S .
RB RB VB NP ADVP ADVP VP .
RB NP PP , VB NP . &quot;
RB DT NN PRP VBD SBAR .
but WP IN S ?
and WP if NP VP ?
PRP VBP PP . PRP RB VB ADVP .
PRP VBP VP , and PRP VBP ADVP VP .
DT VBZ SBAR .
PRP VBP VP .
ADVP NP , but NP VP .
DT VBZ NP . PRP VBZ NP .
any CD IN NP , anybody -- NN JJ NN NN IN S -- NN JJ NN NN .
PRP MD VP .
ADVP , NP VP -- and NP VP -- PRP MD ADVP VP .
DT VBZ PP .
you can VB NP , VB NP PP and RB VB NP .
so i think , IN NP , IN NP , the main thing is that NP ADVP VP .
PRP VBD NP , PP , S .
PRP RB VBD SBAR .
PRP RB VBZ PP .
and DT VBZ VP .
PRP VBP , i hope IN NP .
and the biggest question NP VP is , S ? &quot;
and DT NN VBZ NP .
PRP VBZ S .
and DT VBZ NP . VBP NP .
VBP NP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
there &apos;s DT JJ NN , WHNP S .
and so if NP VP , then we can VB NP .
and IN NP , DT MD VP .
DT MD VP .
RB WRB MD NP VP ?
some of PRP may have VBN PP , but i think for JJS NNS in DT NN , your brain is something like this -- with DT JJ NN IN NP .
PRP VBZ SBAR .
PRP MD VP .
and so i consider myself one of DT NNS , along IN NP .
but IN NP , PRP VBP NP S .
WRB VBP NP VP ? UH PRP VBP S .
RB PRP VP CC VP , and ADVP NP VP , and ADVP NP VP .
and RB PRP VBP NP .
so DT NN WHNP S is IN S .
i mean , it can VB ADJP , but you weren NP VP , you developed it .
and PRP VBP S .
S CC S , and NP VP .
but i bet S VP , and that NP VP , and that NP VP .
and so this is DT JJ JJ NN VP , IN S .
it &apos;d VB NP , SBAR , they play with DT JJ JJ NNS .
and when PRP VBP PP , they find NP VP , or they can be IN NP .
and ADVP NP VP , and NP VP .
and so that NP SBAR ; you needed NN NNS VP .
but PRP VBP SBAR .
DT NN JJ NN RB VB ADVP PP , and RB PRP VBZ SBAR .
UH , PRP VBP PP ADVP , NAC .
and PRP VBP ADVP VP .
NP VP , NN VBZ ADVP VP .
but PRP VBD SBAR .
because IN S VBP NP , then shouldn &apos; t everything just follow NN NNS ?
PRP VBP S .
and so i &apos;d VP .
NP IN , PRP VBD PRT S .
RB PRP VBD NP .
DT VBZ NP .
RB WHNP S VBZ NP .
and PRP MD ADVP VP .
and S PRP VBP VP .
DT VBZ NP .
and RB PRP VBP NP PP . PRP VBP S .
and RB RB VBZ NP .
so WP NP VP is NP PP , and PRP VBZ VP , and PRP VBZ S .
and RB PRP VBD NP PP SBAR .
i went IN NP IN NP , and then i just c@@ ran@@ ked RB IN NP .
for DT JJ NN , i had VP .
DT NN VBZ NP , but PRP VBZ NP S .
RB , VB S .
PRP VBP SBAR ?
i mean , when i &apos;m IN NP RB RB , i do all sorts of JJ NNS , but then other people get on board and i stop doing those things because NP VP .
RB JJ NN VBZ SBAR .
DT JJ NNS IN NP are not RB NNS , but it &apos;s NP CC NP .
and so we knew , IN S , PRP VBP VP .
and RB IN NP SBAR .
we turned off the lights , and then we put it in DT NN and su@@ cked out all the air , and then we cool@@ ed it down now , all alone in the el@@ ev@@ ator , the little ch@@ un@@ k of NN is free VP .
and RB PRP VBD NP .
PRP VBD SBAR .
instead of RB VBG ADVP ADVP , it was VBG , and NP SBAR VBD VP and NN VBZ .
and by VBG NP NP , we were able VP .
RB WHNP S VBZ NP .
WP VBZ NP VP ?
RB VB S .
so in one case : all the trilli@@ ons of NP SBAR are sitting RB and at the same time those same atoms are moving RB CC RB .
RB PRP VBZ ADVP PP .
NP PP PRP VBP VP .
that means that NP VP .
PRP VBP SBAR .
RB .
it was worth lo@@ cking myself in DT JJ NN TO VP .
so if NP VP can VB PP , then why not PRP ?
NP VP , DT VBZ ADVP NP .
S , WP MD NP VP ?
WRB MD NP VP ?
ADVP NP NP PP .
PRP VBZ SBAR , and PRP VP CC VP , we saw that NP VP .
and so PRP VBD S quant@@ um objects just cra@@ mm@@ ed into DT JJ NN .
PRP VBP NP PP .
UH , DT VBZ RB ADJP .
NP VP ; NP VP .
it &apos;s IN S , and that &apos;s NP PP .
VBP NP .
IN NP , PRP VBD SBAR .
our new goal should be that WHADVP S , PRP MD VP .
RB PRP VBP NP ADVP ADVP .
there are NP PP .
but NP PP VBZ SBAR .
RB PRP MD ADVP VP .
RB DT MD VP .
but RB VB NP PP .
VP VBD NP ; NP NP RB RB .
PRP MD VP .
but you know WHNP S .
RB PRP VBZ ADJP S .
but you could go out NN NN JJ , build DT ADJP NN NN , RB RB IN S .
so i pro@@ posed IN S .
later i learned IN S .
they knew that ADVP DT NN MD VP , and they wanted to VB , SBARQ .
at one point , ja@@ vier said to oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o , &quot; what if we took some of our empty land -- what if we just gave it to an em@@ bas@@ sy -- VB NP PP ; give DT IN NP -- and then if people want to go work IN NP or IN NP , they can go get jobs , do everything they do on those em@@ bas@@ sy gro@@ unds that they would otherwise have to VB PP to do ? &quot;
IN NP , NNP VBD PP .
at DT JJ ADJP NN , pe@@ pe lo@@ bo won IN NP IN NP .
PRP VBD NP S .
RB , PRP VBD VP .
through NP PP , NP PP , i tried TO VP .
the first point was DT NN IN NP , like NP SBAR .
we pay NP PP IN NP , but PRP VBZ NP S , and PRP VBZ ADVP NP .
IN NP , NP PP VBD ADVP NP PP .
PRP VBD NP PP .
PRP VBD NP .
NP VP , NN VBD S . &quot;
RB PP PRP VBD PP , PP .
i tried VP , WHADJP S .
and i used this slide showing WHADJP S .
but it was DT ADJP NN , and at NP SBAR , oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o said , NP , ADVP NP VP . &quot;
so the ted@@ talk la@@ id out in very simple terms , a char@@ ter city is a place where PRP VBP PP and then a chance for people to op@@ t IN , VP or not .
so i was VBN PP , this is JJ , this could VB NP .
PRP VBD VP .
so i pres@@ ented another fact - filled lec@@ ture that VBD NP PP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
DT NN RB VBZ NP .
so i was VBG S , if NP VP , you &apos;ve S .
DT VBZ NP .
NN VBD ADVP .
NP PP VBD ADJP .
DT NN IN NP thank PRP ADVP PP , but maybe we could VB NP .
PRP VBP SBAR . &quot;
ADVP NP VP , and NP VP .
and PRP VBD PP .
there would be NP PP .
and PRP RB VBD NP PP .
because the leaders in DT NN ADVP IN NP would need help from NP , SBAR , so everybody can trust that the char@@ ter really will VB VP .
and the insi@@ ght of president lo@@ bo was that that as@@ sur@@ ance of NN WHNP S could be equ@@ ally important IN NP .
PRP VBD CC VBD PP .
DT NN NNS IN NP .
PRP RB MD VP .
and shor@@ tly there@@ after , on janu@@ ary 19@@ th , they vot@@ ed in DT NN TO VP .
in DT NN WHNP S , the vote in NP PP was CD IN CD .
NP , NP , VBD NP .
VP , PRP RB VBP S .
IN NP PRP VBD NP ADVP PP .
immediately after that vote , on febru@@ ary 21@@ st to DT NN , a d@@ ele@@ gation of RB CD hon@@ dur@@ ans went to the two places in DT NN WHNP S .
CD VBZ NP .
this is NP : ADJP .
NN PRP VBP SBAR .
NP SBAR VBZ NP .
PRP VBP ADVP VP .
ADVP IN S , RB GW SBAR .
NP VP ; NP VP .
they &apos;re VP .
one country has RB VBN S .
RB NP SBAR .
PRP RB MD VP .
but NP SBAR VBZ SBAR .
there &apos;s lots of NNS WHNP S &apos;s lots of NP SBAR .
around DT NN , there &apos;s NP SBAR .
ADVP NP NP SBAR .
many of these are a father WP VP .
sa@@ dly , sometimes there are even NNS WHNP S .
RB WHNP PP VBZ NP VP ?
or VP ?
what kind of DT NN is it to VB PP ?
DT VBZ ADJP S .
and NP PP VBD NP S .
do PRP VB SBAR ?
do PRP VB SBAR ?
i recently did a survey with NP , CC NP that NP VP .
RB VBD ADVP ADVP VP .
and these scientists simply docum@@ ented PDT DT JJ NNS SBAR CC SBAR .
and PRP VBD SBAR .
DT NN VBD VP .
NP PP VBD VP .
NP IN NP did PRP VB NP .
VB PP .
do PRP VB SBAR ?
WRB RB VBP NP VP ?
today i want VP .
PRP VBP S .
RB as NP VP , i &apos;m VBG S and i &apos;m VBG S .
RB WRB NP VP , since NP VP , only raise PRP$ NN IN S .
RB , WRB NP VP , and if NP VP are you guys ready to VB PP ?
VBP NP .
so when PRP VBD NP , i used TO VP ; at least at that time it was truly up@@ scale .
PRP VBD NP .
ADVP NP , PRP VBD ADVP PP .
they had CD JJ NNS IN NP and NP PP and NP PP -- and this was during a time when PRP RB VBD S .
PRP VBD S , but IN NP PRP RB VBP NP ?
RB VB NP .
they had RP NP PP , PP .
so PRP CD NN VBD S , and PRP VBD NP , &quot; is DT NN IN S ? &quot;
and PRP VBD PP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
RB VB NP .
PRP VBD NP .
PRP VBD PRT NP .
we there put out NP PP or NP PP , and we looked at NP : ADVP , SBAR ?
more people stopped WHADVP S .
DT JJ NN S is WHPP S .
RB PRP VBP NP .
of NP SBAR , RB CD NN IN NP actually bought NP PP .
of NP SBAR , well now we saw IN S .
now if PRP VBP NP , people were QP NNS more likely VP .
now choo@@ sing not TO VP is probably good for PRP -- at least it &apos;s good for PRP$ NNS -- but it turns out that DT NN NN NN VBZ NP ADVP PP .
PRP VBP S , SBAR .
ADVP PP : JJ NNS .
now i &apos;m going to VB PP NP .
and what we looked IN was whether NP VP , does that affect NNS JJ NN S .
and WHNP S VBD SBAR .
so IN NP , we had NP SBAR .
and WHNP S , RB , EX VBD NP .
so if PRP VBP PP , participa@@ tion rates were around in DT NNS -- still not as high as NP VP .
IN NP , NN NNS VBP ADVP VP .
now it turns out that SBAR , NP VP .
so for DT NNS WHNP S , DT JJR NNS JJ , the more likely people were TO ADVP VP .
the more NNS JJ , the more likely they were VP .
now nei@@ ther of DT JJ NNS are DT NNS IN NP .
well , over DT JJ NN , we have VBN NP PP .
PRP VBP ADJP .
PRP VBP ADJP .
PRP VBP ADJP .
the main reason for this is because , PRP MD VP , but we can &apos; NP ADVP VP .
so what i want VP are four simple techniques -- NNS WHNP S -- that PRP MD ADVP VP .
DT JJ : NN .
PRP VBP VP , but PRP VBZ ADVP VP .
NNS VBP ADVP ADJP . &quot;
PRP VBP ADVP ADJP .
but in fact , what we &apos;re seeing JJR CC JJR SBAR , there is an impro@@ vement of the choo@@ sing experience .
when NNP CC NN ; NN VBD PP , they saw an increase in NNS by CD NN .
when the golden c@@ at corpo@@ ration got VBN PP , they saw an increase in NNS by CD NN -- NP PP UCP .
NP VP , DT JJ NN NN NN VBZ NP NP .
DT JJ NNP NN VBZ NP NP .
but DT JJ JJS NN , NP PP is NN , and it off@@ ers PRP NP : NP .
now in the financial sav@@ ings world , i think one of the best examples WDT VP .
DT JJ NNP NN VBZ ADVP ADVP VP .
for NP SBAR , they &apos;re VBN NP , NAC .
PRP VBP PRN SBAR .
PRP VBP NP . &quot;
and the first thing NP VP is S .
and SBAR VP , nei@@ ther MD NP . &quot;
ADVP IN S , PRP VBD NP .
and g@@ ary said that NP VP .
RB VBZ NP PP .
and PRP VBP SBAR .
and now i &apos;ll VB NP NP S and then i want PRP IN NP your hands if NP VP .
okay . NN WHNP S .
is DT DT ?
RB RB , VB S .
PRP NNS VBD SBAR .
RB WHNP S .
PRP VBP SBAR .
all right .
now in fact , you had obje@@ c@@ tively NP NP around IN NP around , but i would vent@@ ure VP .
because NP VP .
WDT VP .
that in order for people VP , in a very con@@ cre@@ te way .
why do people spend NP PP IN ADVP WHADVP S ?
IN S VBP PP .
and it turns RP IN S .
so a study that i did S -- employees that are DT VBG PP -- and now these people were all in a s@@ ession where they &apos;re VBG NP PP .
and IN NP , PRP VBD NP , but PRP VBD NP .
the one little thing NP VP asked people TO ADVP VP .
by doing that simple thing , there was an increase in NN by 20 percent and there was NP PP UCP account by four percent .
DT JJ NN : NN .
PRP MD VP .
RB PP , RB VBZ NP .
it turns out that PP , NP VP .
but PRP VBP SBAR ?
if i show you 600 maga@@ zin@@ es and i divi@@ de them up into CD NNS , versus i show PRP CD NNS and divi@@ de PRP RP IN NP , you believe that i have given you NP CC NP IN S .
because NP VP .
RB VBP NP .
NP VP and NP VP . &quot;
IN S VBZ NP is NN , NP NP .
UH , RB VBZ NP .
IN S VBZ NP is NN , NP NP .
UH , NP RBR .
RB PRP VBZ PRT SBAR .
NP VP and NP VP , but PRP VBP SBAR ?
DT VBZ NP .
DT NNS VBP S .
and PRP RB VBP NP SBAR .
WP VBP NP VP ?
PRP$ JJ NN : NP PP .
it turns RP S , we &apos;ve just got VP .
PRP VBP S .
PRP VBP VP .
VP : VP .
RB VBZ NP SBAR .
NP VP , ADVP VP .
RB DT NNS VBP PP SBAR .
NP , NP PRN VBD NP .
NNS , NP : NP .
so now WP NP VP is S .
QP IN NP are VBG S .
DT JJ NN IN NP are VBG S .
WP VBP NP VP ?
WHADVP S PRP VBP .
if NP VP , NP VP , that means S .
what PRP VBP SBAR , they &apos;re VBG NP ADVP ADVP .
PRP VBP S .
NP VP , PRP VBP S .
PRP VBZ NP . PRP VBZ NP .
NP SBAR VBZ SBAR .
IN S , PRP VBP SBAR .
even though VP , it still prepar@@ es PRP IN SBAR .
it also gets NP ADJP SBAR , so i &apos;m RBR JJ S .
RB VB NP S .
i have talked about CD NNS for VP -- we can hand@@ le NP , NP ; NP PP .
all of NP SBAR are designed VP -- JJR IN NP , you can use PRP IN NP , ADJP .
because NP VP .
and the more we &apos;re JJ S .
VBP NP ADVP .
hi . PRP VBP NP , PRP VBP NP PP , and PRP RB VBP NP .
PRP VBZ ADJP .
so we &apos;re VBG S .
we all want VP and WRB NP VP , that seemed ADVP , ADVP VP .
but now web video has made it so that NP VP .
NP PP MD VP .
but EX VBP PP .
and of DT , only a tiny percentage ever VBZ NP and VBZ NP and VBZ NP .
RB WRB VBZ NP VP ?
CD NNS : NP , NP .
RB RB , VB S .
UH , PRP$ NN . UH , PRP$ NN .
UH , PRP$ NN !
woo@@ o !
RB , NN !
JJ NN , NN NN VBD NP SBAR .
IN NP , PRP VBD VP .
DT VBZ NP .
but PRP VBD NP .
PRP RB VBD S .
because NP VP .
and PRP VBD VP .
and DT NN VBD ADVP VP .
RB WP VP ?
NN NN RB .
NN NN VBD NP .
IN NP VP CC VP .
it &apos;s fri@@ day , fri@@ day . got ta get down on NNP . everybody &apos;s looking forward to DT NN , NN . fri@@ day , fri@@ day . ge@@ t@@ tin &apos; down on fri@@ day . so you didn &apos; t think that we could actually have DT NN IN S .
NNP JJ NNS VBP SBAR .
PRP VBZ VP .
DT VBZ NP .
and NP , S VBZ S .
RB WP VP ?
INTJ NP VP , DT VBZ ADJP .
and IN S , DT VBP ADVP NP .
but what about NP ?
ADJP NN VP , NP .
NN NN NN IN NP was NP PP S .
but what NP ADJP VBZ SBAR and they shared that IN NP , VBG NP .
and so then DT NN VBN PP .
and RB EX VBP NP .
ADVP IN NP , EX VBD NP .
unlike the CD HYPH NN entertain@@ ment of DT JJ NN , this community participa@@ tion is how PRP VBP NP PP : PP .
RB JJ JJ NN NN VBZ NP .
PRP VBZ NP , PP .
PRP VBZ VP .
and if PRP VBP SBAR , you should know IN S .
RB NNS VBD VP .
NNS VBD VP .
but WHNP S VBZ NP SBAR .
RB VBD NP .
NN VBD NP .
and RB PRP VBD ADJP .
an entire re@@ mix community spr@@ ou@@ ted up NP VP .
IN S , PRP VBP .
and WP MD VP ?
WP VP ? &quot;
WP NNS MD NP VP ?
in DT NN WHADVP S , only that WDT VP can stand RP IN NP .
when DT NN IN NP told PRP IN S , i ad@@ mit i JJ JJ NN RB JJ .
so i got DT NN IN S , but often there are NP SBAR .
IN S , NN NN VBD NP .
and RB DT NN VBZ PP SBAR .
and RB PRP DT VBZ NP PP ...
WP VBZ NP VP ?
o@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h .
WP VBZ NP VP ?
ta@@ ste@@ makers , creative partici@@ p@@ ating communities , complete un@@ expec@@ te@@ dness , these VP and DT JJ NN IN NP WRB NP VP defin@@ es the popul@@ ar@@ ity .
i mean , as VP , NP VP .
DT NN VBZ PP .
and PRP DT RB VBP NP .
and DT VBP RB NP , and PRP VBP ADJP , but they will VB NP .
VBP NP .
how can i speak in 10 minutes about the bon@@ ds of women over three generations , about how the ast@@ on@@ ishing strength of those bon@@ ds took hold in DT NN IN NP hu@@ dd@@ led with PRP$ JJ NN , PRP$ NN and PRP$ NN for CD NNS CC NNS IN NP more than 30 years ago , NNS WHNP S ?
DT VBZ RB NP .
PRP VBZ NP .

he is NP SBAR &apos;s unity and freedom .
VB NP SBAR .
NP , PP , RB VBD NP .
PRP VBD PP .
PRP VBD VP .
PRP VBZ NP .
PRP RB VBD NP PP .
but PRP$ NNS VBP ADJP .
PRP$ NN RB VBD S .
PRP$ NN VBD RB S , and PRP$ NN VBD S , but we en@@ du@@ red .
NP PP VBZ PP .
PRP$ NN , NN , was NP : PP .
for PRP , life had VBN NP PP .
PRP VBD ADJP SBAR .
so IN NP , a boat sli@@ pped RP IN NP .
PDT DT NNS VBD NP .
DT JJS NN VBD PP .
IN NP , PRP$ NN VBD NP .
IN S , RB NP CC NP , RB NP CC NP MD VP .
my first memor@@ ies are from NP : NP into NP , NP .
i don &apos; t remember NP , CC NP .
but i do remember the lights on DT NN NN off DT JJ NN and NP SBAR , the journey &apos;s end too much for PRP , and the first apple NP VP , given to me by DT NNS IN NP .
DT NN VBZ ADVP VP .
IN NP , PRP VBD PP .
and NP PP VBZ NP .
PRP VBD PP .
unlike NP VP , there was NP PP .
NP PP VBD PP .
and NP PP VBD VP , they were VBG ADVP .
PRP$ NN VBD PP , ADVP , S .
RB PRP VBD NP S .
PRP VBD ADJP .
all the dollars were VBN and JJ NN IN NP was VBN SBAR .
CD NNS IN NP .
NP ADVP , IN S .
and there were JJ NP , VP . &quot;
VB ADVP ?
NN VBN PP .
RB VBD NP . &quot;
NP , NP CC NP VBD PP .
my mother was VBN NP-TMP , but we VBD NP NP and VBD PP PP .
PRP$ NN VBD PP PP .
and PRP$ NN VBD S .
PRP VBD SBAR .
and the women came with PRP$ NNS about NP , CC NP .
NNS CC NNS VBD VP .
NNS VBD VP .
PRP VBD PP .
IN NP , PRP VBD NP .
in DT JJ , i was VP , ADVP VP .
but RB NP PP VBD VP .
and for DT NN , WRB NP VP , i was VBN PP .
and NP VP , and NP VP .
tan le , anony@@ mous foot@@ sc@@ ray resi@@ dent , was RB JJ le , re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e and social activ@@ ist , invited TO VP .
PRP VBP SBAR .
PRP VBP SBAR .
PRP VBP SBAR .
PRP VBP SBAR .
i wanted to re@@ treat to NP PP in DT JJ NN -- a grandmother , a mother and two dau@@ gh@@ ters en@@ ding DT NN IN S , telling CD DT NP PP and fall@@ ing JJ , the three of us still in the same bed .
PRP VBD NP SBAR .
PRP VBD NP SBAR .
DT VBD ADVP VP .
RB RB VP , VP VP . &quot;
RB PRP VBD PRT PP .
and DT RBR RB PRP VBD , S .
i met NNS IN NP , ADJP .
and RB IN S , PRP VBD SBAR .
RB VBD S .
and i realized at the same time that it VBZ ADJP , VP : CC VP , but NP S .
because S VP , can RB RB VB S .
i have ste@@ pped IN NP RB RB S .
NP SBAR VBD ADVP VP .
RB VBD NP RB , NP , NP .
RB PRP VBD NP .
i gather@@ ed IN NP NP PP .
IN NP PRP VBD ADJP .
IN NP , PRP VBD NP SBAR .
PRP VBD ADVP PP .
NP VP , but S , CC S .
PRP VBD NP S .
after RB CD NN .
PRP$ NNS RB .
ADVP NP VP , and NP VP .
IN S , VB S .
PRP VBD PRT PP SBAR and DT JJ NN VBD NP .
NML JJ NN VBD PP .
PRP$ NN VBD ADVP SBAR .
PRP$ NN VBD S .
IN NP PRP VBD NP .
with DT NN IN NP , she caused NP PP , and NP SBAR .
VB S .
i was VBG NP PP SBAR .
PRP VP CC VP .
PRP VBD SBAR .
PRP$ NN VBD NP ADVP .
NP RB , PRP VP CC VP .
PRP VP CC VP .
IN NP DT NN VP CC VP .
PRP$ NN VBD NP S .
NP VP why is PRP IN S ? &quot;
NN IN S .
&quot; PRP VBP RB VP . &quot;
IN S , PRP VBZ PP .
given WHNP S and WHADVP S , we can now see IN S .
NN MD VP .
ADVP NP VP , and NP VP .
WP VP ?
yet PRP VBP ADJP .
can i give them NP , VP , NP PP , NP SBAR ?
PRP VBP SBAR .
but IN S , PRP MD .
and RB , NP NP VBZ ADVP NP-TMP PP .
PRP VBP ADVP S .
or is PRP NN ?
RB , IN NP , DT VBZ NP .
RB , NP PP VBD SBAR .
it mix@@ ed IN NP IN NP , but it was NP JJ , IN S .
and WHADVP S , DT NN VBZ SBAR .
RB PP PRP VBD SBAR .
PRP VBD SBAR .
RB PRP VBD S .
NP PP : NP VP .
but PRP VBZ NP .
and IN NP , PRP VBZ NP .
or NNS IN NP .
WHADVP S , PRP VBP NP .
because , of NN , it &apos;s not NP SBAR , but i always want NP VP .
NNS WHADVP S .
RB PRP VBZ NP PP .
but WP VP ?
is PRP NP PP ?
is PRP NP PP ?
WP VP ?
RB DT NN VBZ NP .
but in DT NN , it comes RP IN SBAR .
PRP VBZ RB ADVP SBAR .
RB PRP VBP SBAR .
i just see PRP IN NP WHADVP S .
and VB S .
here we have NP , NP .
but combin@@ ed IN NP , they can VB NP .
but IN NP , PRP VBP SBAR .
so we trick PRP$ NNS , IN S .
and PRP VBP NP PP .
PRP VBZ NP S .
so the things that VBP S , i think NP VP even think about , DT NNS RB IN NP IN NP .
but WHADVP S , DT VBZ ADJP S , SBAR .
RB PRP MD VP .
IN S , DT NNS VBN NP S .
but VP , PRP MD VP .
RB DT JJ NN VBZ SBAR .
RB , NP VP MD VP .
and these two images both ful@@ fill NP : NP .
the third one is IN S .
VB S .
so by mat@@ ching color , contr@@ ast and bri@@ ght@@ ness in DT NNS IN NP , ad@@ ding photogra@@ phic de@@ fe@@ cts like dep@@ th of NN , JJ NNS and NN , we er@@ ase the bor@@ ders between the different images and make it look like CD JJ NN , despite DT NN that CD NN MD VP .
RB RB VBZ DT NN .
PRP MD VP and DT JJR NN VBZ SBAR .
but DT NN VBZ ADVP ADVP VP .
i personally think that NP VP .
but PRP VBZ VP .
and getting DT NN IN NP , i knew that NP VP , TO VP .
RB PP , DT NN VBD VP .
DT NNS VBP PP .
DT JJ NN VBD VP .
and yeah , i even turned DT NN IN NP VP .
RB VP , PRP VBP SBAR .
PRP RB VBZ PP .
RB PRP VBZ PP .
and RB DT NN VBZ ADJP .
and if NP VP , the result can VB ADJP .
ADVP NP VP , and NP VP .
VBP NP .
PRP MD VP .
and PRP RB VBP SBAR .
and NP PP VBZ SBAR .
not in a RB JJ way -- she VBZ PRT NP and VBZ S ?
WRB MD NP VP ? &quot;
and we think , PRP VBP S , that DT VBZ NP SBAR , SBAR .
DT VBZ NP . PRP VBZ NP .
PRP VBZ SBAR .
and DT NN PRP VBP PP .
and UH , PRP VBP SBAR .
and PRP VBD NP PP .
but the thing is IN S .
and it &apos;s colle@@ cted by PRP$ JJ NN as well , so NP VP , but also looking back@@ ward .
but RB VBZ NP .
IN S , PRP VBP SBAR .
so every morning i ho@@ p on PRP$ NN NN and before PRP VBP PP , people start VBG PP , &quot; NP VP . &quot;
but that &apos;s the ni@@ c@@ est thing WDT VP , since DT VBZ NP -- since this could VB VP , it could be used VP .
but on the other hand , it also could be used VP .
IN PP , PRP MD ADVP VP .
RB MD VP .
and people will be able , IN NP , TO VP .
and this is the point where NNS VP CC VP , CC ADVP VP , like NN NN cost explosion , dou@@ bled demand and things like DT .
VP CC VP .
and PRP MD VP .
and NP PP .
PRP VBP NP .
PRP RB RB CD VBP VP .
PRP VBP ADVP SBAR .
DT JJ NN VBZ SBAR .
and S , NP VP .
but WRB MD VP ?
NP VP and NP VP .
NN VBD SBAR .
RB WHNP S , PRP VBD NP .
we set up a website and asked DT NN , NN if you see an a@@ ed , please VB NP , VB NP SBAR , VB NP SBAR , ADJP PP PP sometimes it &apos;s closed , of course .
and NP PP RB VBP VP .
NP SBAR VBD S .
and PRP VBD NP .
PRP VBD NP , S .
and whenever you are IN NP collap@@ ses , PRP MD VP , and IN NP RB VBP NP , to VB NP .
and as of NN , we would like VP .
and PRP MD VP .
and &#91; we &apos;re NP VP .
DT WHADVP S collap@@ ses , MD NP VP , you can find DT .
the other thing NP VP is of NNS RB all over NP SBAR .
DT MD VP , RB TO VP .
so please VP CC VP , but VB NP .
VBP NP .
NN PRP VBP VP .
RB PRP VBP PP .
and PRP$ JJ NN VBZ VP ...
... VP IN NN HYPH NN .
PRP VBZ NP .
hu@@ h . VB PP .
PRP MD VP .
NP VP -- NP VP -- NP VP ...
no .
DT VBZ RB ...
okay .
JJ NN VBZ ...
UH , DT VBZ NP-TMP ?
okay . VBP NP ADVP .
so a couple of years ago PRP started a program to try VP ; we have them work in NN .
DT NN VBZ VP , and PRP VBZ NP PP .
NP VP and NP VP .
RB IN S , PRP VBP NP PP .
and RB PRP VBP NP , SBAR .
but RB WHNP S VBZ SBAR .
RB VB NP .
NNP VBZ NP .
here it kind of looks like he &apos;s VBG PP , but what he &apos;s RB VBG SBAR WRB NP VP .
RB WRB VBD NP VP ?
PRP VBD NP NP-TMP PP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
and PRP VBD SBAR .
but one fellow in NP , NP , noticed NN RB , and IN S .
ADVP NP VP , PRP VBD NP .
PRP VBZ NP .
RB PRP VBP S .
SBAR , NP VP , and NP VP .
and IN S , NN MD VP .
RB PRP VBZ SBAR .
DT VBZ NP .
PRP VBZ NP .
but PRP VBZ S .
PRP VBZ S .
there &apos;s DT NN IN NP who VP CC VP , but to get NNS VP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
RB PRP VBZ S .
and RB VBP VP .
and NNP RB VBD NP PRT S SBAR .
RB PRP RB VBP PP .
and DT VBZ VP , ADVP , ADVP .
IN S , PRP VBP SBAR .
VBG NN RB VBZ NP .
we had NP SBAR JJ NN WHNP S .
PRP VBD NP .
we were told RB IN S .
and DT VBZ NP .
RB VBZ NP ADVP , and PRP VBD NP .
and EX VBP NP .
so an ap@@ p WDT VP , that NNS RB PP .
it suggests WHADVP S .
and ADVP PP PRP .
and NP VP , NP VP , S .
and DT VBZ ADJP .
but what &apos;s ADJP PP is that PRP VBZ SBAR : PP .
and that &apos;s JJ NN , IN PRN S .
now there &apos;s DT ADJP NN IN NP .
it &apos;s NP PP , there are NNS IN NP .
PRP NN JJ NN VBN PRT PP .
NP VP , but NP VP , they &apos;re VP .
and DT NNS VBP NP .
and that &apos;s that WRB NP VP , government is , IN NP , IN NP reilly , &quot; what we do RB that NP VP do alone . &quot;
RB NP PP VBP VP .
and if NP VP , i would VB SBAR , SBAR .
NP VP ; NP VP .
and IN NP ADVP VP NP -- VP NP ? &quot; -- WRB NP VP is going VP .
RB PRP VBP SBAR .
and UH NP PP , PRP VBD SBAR .
well after CD NNS , i &apos;ve VB PP SBAR .
DT VBZ NP .
PRP VBZ ADVP SBAR .
if you should ever have the chance TO VP , as our fellow scot@@ t sil@@ ver@@ man did as part of the program -- in fact , they all do that -- you will find that people call NN IN NP , including having an o@@ pos@@ sum stuck in PRP$ NN .
RB JJ VBZ DT NN .
PRP VBZ NP PP .
PRP VBD S . PRP VBZ PP .
and finally , he says , JJ NN , can PRP ADVP VP CC VP CC VP ? &quot;
RB IN S . so boo@@ ya IN NP .
but NP NP .
NNP VBD SBAR .
PRP VBZ NP .
RB PRP VBP S .
DT VBZ NP .
so one day -- DT VBZ NP -- this came in : JJ NN in PRP$ NN . can &apos; NP VP .
WRB VBP NP VP ? &quot;
but WHNP S VBZ ADJP .
RB NNP VBD VP .
but IN NP , RB NN MD VP .
and IN NP , DT NN VBD NP .
and the next report NP VP said , IN S .
o@@ pos@@ sum ? check . VBG ? ye@@ p .
VBD NP PP . VBD ADVP .
NN JJ NN . &quot;
pretty simple .
RB DT VBZ ADJP . DT VBZ NP .
and PRP VBZ ADVP NP .
but PRP VBZ ADVP NP PP .
and PRP VBP S .
PRP VBP ADVP VP .
ADVP NP VP , but NP VP .
PRP VBD NP .
and it could have VBN NP PP SBAR .
WHADVP S , PRP VBP NP .
NP VP , PRP RB VBZ NP .
now CD IN NP is IN S .
CC NP VP , but NP VP .
that NP VP .
now how many times have we ele@@ cted DT JJ NN -- and RB PRP VBP NP S -- and RB PRP VBP ADVP and PRP VP , CC ADVP VP ?
NP SBAR VBZ NP .
and WDT NP VP .
and PRP VBP SBAR .
but it &apos;s that NP , NP , CC ADVP NP VBP S .
NNS VBP S .
IN S , PRP VBP VP .
because NP SBAR .
PRP VBP S .
so that NP VP .
have PRP VBN NP ?
it &apos;s DT NN IN NP .
DT VBZ S , SBAR .
now for NP SBAR , it &apos;s NN WHNP S .
PRP VBP S .
do we really think PRP VB S ?
NP VP , but NP VP .
the good news is that NP VP .
and there &apos;s a generation out RB WHNP S the systems the right way .
RB NP PP VBZ NP , so PRP VBP , ADVP , ADJP .
DT VBZ NP .
they &apos;re not VBG SBAR .
NP VP , and NP VP .
so WRB NP VP , they don JJ NN NN IN ADJP IN S .
PRP VBP S .
PRP VBP S .
and DT NNS VBP S .
that could VB VP .
and ADVP , NP VP , and NP VP .
but these app@@ s are IN NP , and we &apos;re CONJP NP , NP .
NP VP , PRP VBP NP .
and PRP VBP RB VP .
so the question i have for DT IN NP RB : when PRP VBZ PP , are we RB going VP , or are we RB going VP ?
VBP NP .
because i usually take the role of trying to VB PP SBAR , and i thought that , since i was among friends here , i would tell you what i really think and try to look back and try TO VP .
RB PRP VBP VP .
CC ADVP .
DT VBZ ADVP NP .
WP NP VP you is not RB RB NP , CC NP .
this happens TO VP .
and the interesting thing about it is that DT NN , UH RB NP SBAR , VBZ NP .
IN NP , DT NN RB VBZ NP PP .
and DT VBZ NP .
NP ADJP VBZ VP .
and DT NNS RB WP PRP VBP VP .
RB , IN S .
if NP VP here .
RB WRB VBP NP VP ?
well the answer is , if i dre@@ w PRP IN NP WHADVP , S , the graph@@ s look sort of sil@@ ly .
PRP RB RB VB PP .
and PRP VBP S .
now if i graph , for NP , NP , say NN NN , IN NP , it would VB ADJP , it would look like DT JJ NN .
but WHADVP S , NNS VBP ADVP VP .
so if transpor@@ tation technology was VBG PP NP-TMP , i would be able VP .
PRP VBZ RB VP .
and there &apos;s NN JJ PP where PRP VBP PP NP-TMP .
now DT NN WHNP S is , SBAR , NP VP .
NNS RB MD VP .
NP PP VBZ VP .
either it &apos;s VP , or maybe it &apos;s VP .
DT VBZ NP .
RB PRP VBP NP , so PRP RB RB VB S .
IN FRAG , DT VBZ SBAR .
we &apos;re sort of on NP PP .
and so what PRP VBP VP , what PRP VBP VP , is WP VP ?
WP VP ?
because NP VP .
now WRB NP VP , the future was RB PP CD , and people used VP .
now here &apos;s a conference WHPP S , and you notice IN S .
PRP VBZ PP .
so IN NP , the future has RB RB VBN VP .
RB PRP VBP SBAR .
DT NN VBZ VP . PRP MD VP .
and we know that it just doesn NP VP .
so WP NP VP is WHNP S , WHNP IN S .
now in order VP i &apos;m going VP .
because NP VP is VP .
so DT NN NN WHNP S is NP PP .
RB PRP VBP SBAR .
so if PRP VBP ADVP NP-TMP , the earth was DT JJ , JJ NN IN NP .
and if PRP VBP PP SBAR , we begin TO VP .
and i think that there &apos;s theor@@ ies WDT VP .
and some of NP PP had NP PP WHNP S .
and NP SBAR VBD S .
and DT VBD NP .
but now those dro@@ ps of NP , SBAR .
and NP SBAR , PRP VBD ADVP NP .
and RB DT NN VBD ADJP .
in fact , the dro@@ ps WDT VP , grew RBR and in@@ cor@@ por@@ ated JJR NNS and divi@@ ded JJR .
RB DT VBD S , S .
now that NNS ADVP NP , but WRB NP VP was WHADVP S .
ADVP IN NP , DT JJ NNS VBD S .
they learned VP .
so in other words , they worked out , in this min@@ d@@ less sort of NP , NP .
the amazing thing is IN S .
in NN NP PP , PRP$ NNS , is RB NP CC NP .
IN NP , DT NN NN VBZ VP .
in NN , CD IN NP is S .
and i &apos;ve VBN ADVP NP .
but this has in it -- what i did is i took DT NN -- the code has standard letters that PRP VBP PP -- and i wrote my business card onto DT NN IN NP and am@@ pli@@ fied it 10 to the 22 times .
so if NN MD VP , i have NN IN NP , and it &apos;s right here .
if NP VP , i MD VP and VBD NP PP .
RB WP VBD NP ?
VP VBD NP .
and DT VP : SBAR .
but then there was DT ADJP NN WHADVP S , WDT VP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
RB DT VBZ SBAR .
some bacteria figured out how TO VP , and it went around sort of VP , and now we have DT NN IN NP .
RB WHNP S , IN NP , VBD PP ADVP ; PRP VBD ADJP .
so they survi@@ ved or they failed together , WDT VP .
now the transition point happened when DT NNS VBD ADJP SBAR .
and RB NP SBAR VBD NP-TMP .
and at DT NN , we have NP VP .
and IN NP , PRP VBP NP .
PRP VBP NP .
your skin cell is RB JJ PP .
so these communities began TO VP .
RB NP SBAR VBZ PP .
NP PP , RB , VBD PP .
and PRP VBD S .
and DT VBP NP .
RB NNS VBP NP SBAR .
and in NN , they began VP .
and DT VBD NP .
and DT VBD NP NP .
because at DT NN , an individual -- learning could happen PP , CONJP PP .
so NP VP , for NN , learn RB VP and it got JJ JJ NN S .
that could happen within the lifetime of DT JJ NN , whereas before NP VP , that would VB VP .
so that JJ NN , NP SBAR .
PRP MD VP .
but RB WHNP S VBD NP .
and IN NP , NP SBAR VBZ NP .
PRP VBZ ADVP NP SBAR .
RB PRP VBP NP .
i &apos;m VBG S .
but we &apos;re VP .
RB DT VBZ NP ADVP S .
and RB , IN NP , WHNP S , VBP VP .
we &apos;re VP .
RB PP , NP PP VBD NP .
tele@@ ph@@ ony , computers , vide@@ ot@@ ap@@ es , cd - NP CC ADVP on are PDT PRP$ JJ NNS WHNP S .
and it ADVP VBZ NP ADVP PP and JJ S .
RB RB , NN MD VP .
and you saw ty NP NP WHADVP S .
RB RB PRP VBP SBAR .
RB NP PP VBD NP .
and DT JJ NNS , IN NP , VBD NP-TMP .
RB DT JJ NNS , UCP , VBD NP-TMP .
and DT JJ NNS , IN NP , VBP S .
the process is VP CC VP , i guess , WHNP SQ -- WHADVP S .
ADVP SBAR , DT RBR PRP VBZ .
and PRP VBP SBAR .
PRP VBP S .
now PRP NP PP , and i know IN S .
so right now , what PRP VBP is i NP PP that NP VP .
PRP VBP SBAR .
EX VBP NP .
instead , what i do and what the designers at VBG NNS do is we think IN NP and then we hand PRP IN NP and the machine takes PRP IN SBAR , ADVP IN S .
and IN NP , RB PRP VBZ NP PP .
NP SBAR VBZ NP .
so WP NP VP is S NP SBAR .
so IN NP , in DT ADJP NNS , we can RB VB NP PP .
INTJ , NP , MD NP VP .
now would you please run DT IN NP , run DT IN NP , and pick out DT NNS WHNP S . &quot;
RB PP , PRP VBP SBAR .
VB S .
RB VB NP .
so of course , JJ NNS IN NP are RB JJ S , IN S .
but NP PP , PP , MD VP .
and i say , S , MD NP VP .
save DT . VB PRT NP .
and RB VB S .
and VB S . &quot;
VB NP and NP VP , and NP VP .
so i &apos;ve VBN ADVP NP .
UH , NN UH VB NP . &quot;
VBP NP ADVP .
VB NP ADVP .
and VP CC VP .
UH NP PP VBZ NP .
so i can do NP PP IN NP , IN NP .
IN NP , PRP VBP PRT PP .
in NN , they are NP SBAR .
ADVP IN S , PRP MD VP .
PRP VBP VP .
PRP VBP NP .
but PRP VBP NP .
and IN NP , PRP VBP , i &apos;m very confi@@ dent that NP VP .
IN NP , PRP$ NN VBD PP .
i was VBG PP ADVP , and he VBZ PRT NP and VBZ , &quot; UH VB . look at DT .
it says , VB S . &apos; doesn &apos; t that VBP S ? &quot;
IN NP , PRP VBP SBAR .
RB PRP VBP VP .
and PRP VBZ S .
and RB , PRP VBP S .
RB PP , PRP VBZ S .
we &apos;re RB VBG NP S .
RB PRP VBZ S .
NP VP and NP VP .
RB NP PP VBP VP .
PRP VBP S .
and WP NP VP is S .
RB PRP VBP NP and PRP MD VP .
PRP VBP ADVP PP .
but PRP VBP SBAR .
PRP VBP SBAR .
and PRP VBP SBAR .
RB NN VBZ VP , and PRP VBP SBAR .
PRP$ NN VBZ ADVP PP PP .
PRP VBD PP , PP .
and we were IN NP IN SBAR . &quot;
so back in NP , SBAR .
RB PRP VBP NP PP .
back then , when NN , DT JJ JJ NN NN , WRB NP VP , he &apos;d VB PRT NP , he &apos;d VP MD VP .
RB PRP VBP NP PP .
NP SBAR VBD SBAR .
and DT VBD S .
PRP VBD NP S .
i was terri@@ fied IN NP IN S .
and PRP VBD SBAR .
WHADVP S , PRP$ NN VBD NP NP .
and NP PP VBD NP PP .
PRP VBD NP PP PP .
ADVP NP VP and NP VP .
PRP VBD NP PP .
and so i jum@@ ped in , NP VP .
PRP VBP VP .
and so WRB NP VP , i saw PRP IN NP .
PRP MD VP .
PRP MD VP .
PRP VBZ ADVP NP .
NN VBZ VP .
but WP VBP NP VP ?
RB PRP VBP S .
RB PRP VBZ , S . &quot;
and so -- it says , VP NP .
and RB PRP VBP NP .
at various points , a little letter dro@@ ps RP IN NP -- and the i@@ pad knows WHADVP S .
NP PP VBZ ADJP .
RB PRP VBP VP .
and i don NP VP .
NP PP , PP , VBD ADVP ADJP .
and RB RB RB PRP VBP S .
and PRP RB VBP NP PP .
DT NN WHNP S was IN S .
and so over here , DT NN and DT NN becomes NP SBAR .
and PRP VBZ PRT NP .
ADVP , NP VP , but NP VP .
DT VBZ NP .
PRP VBZ NP PP PP ADVP .
RB PRP VBP ADVP VP .
NP SBAR VBZ VP .
RB RB , DT VBP NP .
RB PRP VBP S and PRP VBP S , but WHADJP NNS IN PP VBP PP ?
these poor ap@@ sar@@ as have VBN VP .
and RB PRP VBP S .
and NP SBAR .
speaking of DT JJ NN , i think DT JJ NN VBZ VP is that children have VBN VP haven &apos; t been able VP .
but RB with JJ NN , we can RB VB NP ADVP PP .
one of DT NNS IN NP is that PRP VBP VP .
WHADVP S , PRP VBD NP .
and RB NNS VBP SBAR .
so in VP , you need TO VP .
IN NP , PRP VBP S .
and WP VP is IN S .
DT NN IN NP VBZ PRT NP and VBZ , ADJP SBAR . &quot;
NP PP VBZ , SBAR . &quot;
and PRP VBZ NP PP .
IN NP , EX VBP NP .
in the next book , we plan IN S and IN NP , you see DT NN IN NP appear IN NP .
IN NP , PRP$ NN VBZ VP .
and so you need VP .
we &apos;re VP , we &apos;re NP VP , and magic and technology can VB ADVP .
PRP VBP S .
we &apos;re VP and PRP ADVP IN NP WDT NP VP .
VBP NP .
UH DT VBZ NP .
PRP VBP NP PP , PP , PP .
i spend NP PP IN NP .
and VP CC VP , has VBN S .
and NP PP VBZ SBAR .
and PRP MD ADVP VP .
and sometimes WRB NP VP , it has NP SBAR .
and PRP VBP SBAR .
and PRP VBP SBAR .
and i think what PRP VBP SBAR .
IN S PRP MD VP , but IN S PRP MD VP .
and RB PRP VBP S .
and PRP VBP S .
PRP RB VBD PP PP .
i grew up in DT NN WHNP S , and IN S .
NP VP , NP VP , NP VP .
PRP VBD NP .
PRP VBD NP .
PRP VBD NP .
PRP$ NNS VBD VP .
she was VBN PP ADVP VP .
CC NP VP , but NP VP .
WHADVP S , PRP VBD VP and PRP VBD S .
and PRP VBD VP .
and an hour or two S CC S , do PRP RB VBP S ? &quot;
and if PRP VBD SBAR .
and PRP RB VBD NP .
and DT JJ NN VBD SBAR .
PRP$ NN VBD NP .
and sometimes WRB NP VP , it would VB ADJP .
PRP$ NNS MD VP .
and i remember , WRB NP VP , VP , VP , and all of PRP$ NNS were running RB .
and PRP$ NN VBD VP .
and IN RB PRP VBD SBAR .
S CC S , but NP VP .
and after RB CD CC CD minutes of DT , she got up and she came across DT NN and she took me by DT NN and she said , &quot; come on , br@@ y@@ an . you and i are going to have DT NN . &quot;
and PRP VBP NP SBAR .
PRP RB MD VP .
she took PRP RP RB and she said , VP , i &apos;m VBG S , but you don NP VP . &quot;
PRP VBD NP . &quot;
PRP VBD , &quot; RB PRP VB ADJP . &quot; PRP VBD , S . &quot;
then she sat PRP RP and she looked IN NP and she said , IN S . &quot;
and PRP VBD , SBAR . &quot;
PRP VBD , SBAR . &quot;
PRP MD ADVP VP .
and RB PRP VBD , SBAR . &quot;
PRP VBD NP . &quot;
she said , VP . &quot;
PRP VP , NP , and PRP VBP S . &quot;
INTJ NP VP , so NP VP , NP INTJ , NN . i &apos;ll S . &quot;
then she said , &quot; DT JJ NN S . &quot;
S CC S , FRAG , NP . PRP VBD SBAR . &quot;
then finally she said , VP . &quot;
INTJ NP VP , so NP VP , NP INTJ , NN . i &apos;ll S . &quot;
i grew RP IN NP , and i have NP ADJP .
when i was RB CD CC CD , one day my brother came home and he had DT NML IN NP -- i don JJ NNS VBP SBAR -- and he grab@@ bed PRP and PRP$ NN and we went out in DT NNS .
and S PRP RB VBD .
and PRP VBD NP and PRP VBD NP PP and PRP VBD NP , and they off@@ ered PRP IN NP .
PRP VBD , PP , no , no . that &apos;s okay . you all go ahead . i &apos;m not going VP . &quot;
PRP$ NN VBD , RB VB PRT . PRP VBP VP ; PRP RB VBP SBAR .
NP VP , PRP$ NN VBD NP . VB NP . &quot;
PRP VBD , IN NP , PRP VBP S . NN NN DT go RB . NN NN DT go RB . &quot;
and RB PRP$ NN VBD S .
PRP VBD , S ? VB NP . &quot;
then he looked IN NP RB RB and he said , VP . &quot;
NP VP , ADVP ADVP , WHNP SQ ? &quot;
PRP VBD , S . &quot;
PRP VBD VP .
and PRP VBP VP .
PRP VBP VP .
PRP VBP SBAR .
but PRP VBP ADJP , and PRP VBP VP .
PRP VBP SBAR ; PRP VBP SBAR .
when PRP VBP NP , we can say NNS IN NP IN S .
PRP MD VP .
WHADVP S PRP MD VP .
PRP$ NN VBD PP PP .
PRP$ JJ NNS VBD PP .
and DT VBD NP .
UH PRP VBP VP .
DT NN VBZ ADJP NP-TMP SBAR .

DT JJ NNS RB VBZ NP .
PRP VBP NP .
and NP , PP , VBZ ADVP VP .
in JJ NNS , IN NP EX VBZ NP , EX VBZ NP , DT VBZ VP .
QP JJ NNS IN NP is PP , PP , PP .
in urban communities across NP : NP : 50 to 60 percent of DT JJ NNS IN NP are in NN CC NN or on NN CC NN .
PRP$ NML JJ NN RB VBG VP , they &apos;re RB VBN PP .
we have DT NN IN NP .
NN , RB NN , VBZ NP .
and RB , PRP VBP S .
NP PP VBP VP .
PRP VBP VP .
PRP VBZ ADJP .
PRP VBP S .
PRP$ NN IN NP , IN NP , actually perman@@ ently dis@@ en@@ fran@@ ch@@ is@@ es PRP IN S .

DT JJ NN IN NP .
PRP VBP NP PP .
PRP VBZ UCP .
in many ways , we &apos;ve been VBN S ?
and DT VBZ NP .
but RB VBZ NP .
the other way of VP , do NP VP ?
NP VP , PRP VBZ ADJP .
NP PP VBZ VP .
for NP SBAR , we &apos;ve RB VBN NP .
NP PP -- NP ADJP .
NP VP , PRP VBZ ADJP .
in NN , we would RB VB S .
but RB PRP MD VP .
PRP VBZ RB NP .
PRP VBZ RB NP .
PRP VBZ RB NP .
PRP VBP NP PP .
PRP VBP PP .
and it &apos;s JJ , WHADVP S .
i tell PRP IN NP , NP SBAR .
PRP VBP SBAR .
but IN NP , DT VBD NP .
IN NP , NNS VBD S .
PRP VBD S .
PRP VBD NP .
and these older people come up to me now and they say , &quot; NN NN , you give talks , you make spee@@ ches , you tell people TO VP history after 9 / 11 . &quot;
PRP VBP S . &quot;
and DT NN IN NP , IN NP , was VBN PP .
and yet , we have IN NP NP SBAR .
PRP VBP NP SBAR .
and because PP , NP ADVP NP VP we &apos;ve VBN ADVP .
PRP VBP ADVP VP .
PRP VBP ADVP VP .
we have NP VP , and i believe S .
IN NP , NNS VBD SBAR .
in NNP , ADVP IN NP , EX VBD NP , but IN NP NP NP VBN NP .
PRP VBD VP .
it was JJ IN S , &quot; well you know S . &quot;
PRP VBD , SBAR .
and RB RB , PRP MD ADVP VP . &quot;
and the room got very quie@@ t , and this woman said , &quot; there &apos;s DT NN , with our history , we could ever engage IN NP .
it would VB ADJP PP , PP . &quot;
and PRP VBD PP .
what would it feel IN S ?
PRP VBP SBAR .
PRP MD VP .
and yet , in this country , in the states of the old south , we ex@@ ec@@ ute people -- where you &apos;re 11 times more likely to VB NP SBAR -- in the very states where there are bu@@ ried in DT NN DT NNS IN NP .
and RB , EX VBZ S .
UH PRP VBP SBAR .
that WHADVP S , DT ADJP NNS VBP ADVP VP .
PRP VBP NP .
PRP VBP NP . PRP VBP NP .
PRP VBP NP .
but ADVP , NP VP , NN , NN , NN .
and IN NP , PRP VBZ ADJP .
because ultimately we are talking IN NP VP .
and for PRP that means NP VP .
but VBG PP PP .
NP VP , PRP DT VBP S .
PRP VBP . ADJP SBAR , IN FRAG .
NP , NP VBZ RB PP ADVP .
PRP VBP PP .
and it &apos;s that NP VP .
NP , NP , VBD PP .
he said , &quot; WHADVP S , but RB WHNP S and be a wit@@ ness . &quot;
well DT NN IN NP is RB RB IN NP .
there is no VP attention to NN , to NN , to NN , to NN , to NN .
now i will VB NP SBAR .
PRP MD VP .
PRP VBD NP .
and m@@ s. par@@ ks used to come back to NN every now and then , and she would get together with two of PRP$ ADJP NNS , these older women , NNP NNP WHNP S -- amazing JJ JJ woman -- and virg@@ ini@@ a dur@@ r , a white woman , WP$ NN , NNP NNP , VBD NP .
and DT NNS MD VP .
and every now and then m@@ s. car@@ r would call PRP , and she &apos;d VP , VP , m@@ s. par@@ ks is VBG PP . we &apos;re going TO VP .
do PRP VB S ? &quot;
and PRP VBP SBAR . &quot;
and PRP VBD PRN SBARQ ? &quot;
PRP VBD , SBAR . &quot;
S CC S , PRP MD ADVP VP .
PRP MD VP .
and one time i was over there listening to S , CC S and NP VP .
VB NP SBAR . &quot;
and PRP VBD S .
NP VP , RB ADVP NP VP .
PRP VBP VP .
PRP VBP VP .
PRP VBP VP .
PRP VBP VP .
PRP VBP VP .
PRP VBP VP . &quot;
i gave PRP NP , CC SBAR , NP . &quot;
PRP VBD , IN NP . &quot;
and that &apos;s when NNP NNP VBD SBAR . &quot;
and PRP RB VBP SBAR .
PRP VBP S .
IN S VBZ NP .
PRP VBP VP .
PRP VBZ ADVP VP .
IN S PRP VBP ADVP VP .
PRP VBP SBAR .
NP VP , PRP VBP RB NP .
NP VP , PRP VBP RB NP .
NP VP , PRP VBP RB NP .
and IN PP DT RB VBZ NP .
i also believe that IN NP , and RB IN NP , that NP VP .
PRP VBP SBAR .
NP ADVP VP , PP , NP VP .
and finally , i believe that , despite DT NN IN S , we will ultimately not be VBN PP , we won &apos; t be jud@@ ged by PRP$ NN , we won &apos; t be jud@@ ged IN NP .
ultimately , you ju@@ dge the character of DT NN , not by WHADVP S , but by WHADVP S .
because NP VP .
PRP RB VBP PRT PP . PRP VBP NP PP .
PRP RB VBP ADJP .
PRP VBP VP .
RB DT NNS VBP ADVP PP .
and PRP VBP VP .
and PRP VBP PP and PRP VBP NP , and he &apos;s VBN VP .
S , UH , WRB VBD NP VP ?
WRB MD NP VP ?
CC NP VP , but NP VP .
and i was RB RB JJ CD NN and i starting NN , well go@@ sh , if DT NN MD VP , the ju@@ dge must have JJ NN .
UH , JJ , DT NN VBZ NP .
PRP MD VP .
and because NP VP , i started VP .
and PRP VBD NP .
and i started VBG PP , and the head of DT NN was : &quot; motion VP . &quot;
and PRP VBP PP SBAR .
RB S IN SBAR , it &apos;s DT NN .
and the next morning , i wo@@ ke RP and i thought , RB did PRP dream WDT UCP ?
and PP , ADVP VP NP , but NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
and i finally decided , INTJ , NP VP .
and NP VP and NP VP .
and NP VP and NP VP .
and PRP VBD VP .
and NP ADVP VP and NP VP .
and as NP VP , there was NP SBAR .
WRB S , S CC S who are PRP ? &quot;
i said , &quot; NP VP . &quot; he said , IN S ? &quot; NP VP yes , sir . &quot;
and NP VP and NP VP .
and PRP VBD PP .
PRP VBD , SBAR . &quot;
and PRP VBP S .
it connected deeply with NP PP about NN , about NP PP , to NP SBAR .
UH PRP VBD PP .
and RB RB IN S , DT NN VBD NP S .
NP VP , VBD NP VP ? &quot;
NP VP , FRAG , NP . PRP VBD . NN CC PRP VBD S .
and NNS VBD S .
PRP VBD VP .
and NN NNS VBD UCP .
and before i knew PRP , the cour@@ tro@@ om was filled with NNS JJ SBAR .
and IN PP , PRP MD VP .
and NP VP , and NP VP .
PRP VBD NP ADVP .
and finally , this older black man with NP PP came IN NP and sat RP PP , RB PP .
NP RBR DT NN VBD SBAR .
and IN NP EX VBD NP .
and NP VP and NP VP .
S , JJ NN , WP VBP NP VP ? &quot;
and this older black man stood up and he looked at DT NN and he looked at PRP and he said , &quot; NP VP . &quot;
i &apos;ve VB PP , but NP PP .
IN S VBD NP SBAR .
that NP VP .
that NP PP VBP S .
QP IN NP , IN NP WP VP , hold on .
so you heard and saw an obvious desire by NP , NP , VP CC VP .
NP PP , WP MD NP VP ?
RB EX VBP NP .
if you live in NP PP , PP , there &apos;s a refer@@ end@@ um coming up this spring WRB ADVP ADVP VP .
for example , here in california we &apos;re going VP .
and RB , NP PP VBP NP .
NP PP VBP NP .
RB RB VBZ DT NN S .
and DT NN MD VP .
and PRP VBP SBAR .
RB NP VP .
and NP PP VBZ ADVP SBAR .
WP MD NP VP ?
UH RB DT JJ NN NN VBZ VP .
NP PP RB IN NP .
PRP VBD NP .
DT NNS WHADVP S .
and PRP VBD VP .
and so we have three stri@@ kes laws WDT VP .
PRP VBP SBAR .
and PRP VBP SBAR .
and PRP VBP SBAR .
ADJP , PRP VBP SBAR .
PRP VBP NP .
VBP NP ADVP PP . VBP NP .
NP , PP , VBP VP .

UH , PRP$ NN .
so DT VBP NP i colle@@ cted IN NP -- could have RB VBN NP .
the point is IN S .
and RB VBZ NP .
DT NN IN NP bring RP NP NP IN S .
and because NN VBZ ADJP SBAR called the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala .
RB DT NN VBZ NP , NP .
PRP VBZ CC VBZ PP .
so VBN NP , PRP MD ADVP VP .
and NP VP , VP , NN VBZ ADJP .
so given DT IN NP DT NN , CD NNS DT NN , it &apos;s no wonder that PRP VBP ADJP .
PRP VBZ NP SBAR .
but RB DT VBZ RB NP .
RB ADVP , PP .
perhaps the tremendous progress we &apos;ve VBN PP PP are , in fact , acceler@@ ating to a point that PRP VBP NP PP S .
now i &apos;m not VBG SBAR -- we sur@@ ely do .
and IN NP , PRP VBP ADVP VP , but RB PRP VB NP PRT .
RB VB S .
over the last hundred years , DT JJ JJ NN VBZ ADVP VP , average per NP VP has tri@@ pl@@ ed .
NN NN VBZ VP .
VB PP .
steve pin@@ ker has VBN NP SBAR .
and charles ken@@ ny IN S .
PRP RB VBP VP .
and JJ NNS VB NP .
and PRP VBP S .
IN NP , PRP VBP SBAR .
think of this , in america today , the majority of NNS IN NP still have electricity , water , toi@@ lets , re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators , television , mobile phones , air condi@@ tion@@ ing and cars .
NP PP , NP PP , could VB ADVP VP .

my good friend ray kurz@@ weil showed that NP SBAR VBZ PP .
that &apos;s WRB NP VP .

and imagine IN S .

and we teach PRP$ NNS NP , CC SBAR .
and every year we ask PRP TO VP .
think IN NP IN , S .
NP PP MD VP .

PRP VBZ PP .
NP VP , NP VP , and NP VP .

but NP PP , PRP VBD VP .
NP VP , NN VBD NP .
PRP VBZ NP SBAR .
you see , RB IN S , S .
PRP VBZ NP .
but then DT NN IN NP came ADJP NN ADVP SBAR .
RB VB S .
PRP VBP PP .
ladies and gentle@@ men , we are IN NP .
NP PP VBZ SBAR .
NP VP , PRP VBZ PP .
and RB VBZ NP ADVP .
for the first time , this year the cost of ADJP NN is CD NN IN FRAG .
NP PP VBD NP NP-TMP .
last month , mit put out a study showing that PP , NP VP DT NML VBN PP .
and IN S , PRP RB VBP NP .
RB PRP VBP PP .
do you remember WHADVP S IN S ?
PRP VBD NP . WP VBD NP VP ?
VB NP . &quot;
because NP VP .
PRP VBP PP .
yes , 9@@ 7@@ .@@ 5 percent is sal@@ t@@ water , two percent is ice , and we fight NP NP PP , but here too there is NN .
and EX VBZ NP .
RB NP , NP .
and the conversation i had with NN NN DT NN , NP PP , S : S -- NP SBAR , it is the size of a small dor@@ m room re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ator .
it &apos;s able TO VP .
DT NN IN NP has RB VBN S .
and IN NP RP , WDT NP VP , coca - cola will VB NP ADVP PP .
DT VBZ NP .
and PRP VBP VP .
my goo@@ dness , we &apos;re VBG S .
think IN NP , IN S re@@ ag@@ an did 25 years ago .
and if PRP VBP SBAR clin@@ ton did 15 years ago .
PRP VBP S .
better than that , the things that you and i spent NP PP IN -- gps , h@@ d video and still images , libr@@ aries of books and music , medical diagno@@ stic technology -- are now literally de@@ materi@@ ali@@ zing and demon@@ e@@ ti@@ zing into your cell@@ phone .
RB NP PP VBZ SBAR .
last month , i had NP PP .
we &apos;re challen@@ ging teams around DT NN to RB VB NP PP , because PRP VBZ SBAR , PRP MD VP , you can do DT NN NN VBP .
and VP , PRP VBZ S .
so literally , imagine this device in DT NN IN NP where EX VBP NP .
when NP SBAR VBP , it calls DT NN and pre@@ v@@ ents DT NN IN S .
but RB , RB VBZ NP .
PRP VBP S .
RB DT JJ NNS RB VBP NP .
PRP RB VBD NP PP .
and IN NP , NP PP VBZ VP .
IN NP , PRP VBD ADVP ADVP , VP .
by NP , SBAR .
NP SBAR VBP VP .
WP MD NP VP ?
WP MD NP VP ? WP MD NP VP ?
and RB IN S , PRP VBP ADVP S .
DT NNS VBP NP .
and they will get heal@@ thi@@ er by VP , and they &apos;ll become RBR VBN PP .
RB WP MD NP VP ?
WRB IN NP .
what about VBG NP ?
WP MD NP VP ?
WHNP PP NP VP ?
the one thing PRP VBP VP is that NP VP MD VP .
VB S .
RB VBZ NP SBAR .
PRP VBZ NP .
PRP VBD PRT PP PP .
and this is NP SBAR .
and WHADVP S VBZ NP .
and PRP VBZ ADJP .
and RB PP , PRP VBZ VP .
and DT NN VBZ VP .
and PRP VBZ S .
and it showed IN S .
and when these individuals went and looked at who was NP PP , it wasn &apos; t an mit professor , it wasn &apos; t a cal@@ tech student , it was a person from england , from man@@ che@@ ster , a woman WP , PP , VP the world &apos;s best protein fol@@ der .
ladies and gentle@@ men , WP VP is the fact that NP VP .
PRP VBP NP .
PRP VBP NP .
PRP VBP NP .
and we have QP JJ NNS VBG ADVP S , S .
PRP VBP VP .

and maybe i &apos;ve been ADVP SBAR .
IN S , VB S .
NP , RRC ?
NP VP , PRP VBP S .
NP ADVP VP , VP NP ?
NN VBZ VP .
and RB VBZ NP PP .
JJ NN NN VBZ ADJP , and PRP VP CC VP .
PRP VBP VP .
PRP VBZ VP .
ADVP NP VP WHNP NP .
DT VBZ SBAR .
that means hit DT NN IN NP , it dro@@ pped , it didn S , and WP VP &apos; t get RB IN NP and the run@@ ner was safe .
CD NNS out IN NP .
do PRP VB SBAR ?
JJ , RB JJ , NP NML .
do PRP VB SBAR ?
DT NNS NN WHNP S .
JJ -- ADVP ADJP -- the last major NN NN player TO VP .
now let &apos;s take DT NN IN NP WHADVP S .
VB S .
RB NP VP , VBZ NP ?
now suppose you live IN NP and you have a loved one WP VP and your family doctor re@@ f@@ ers that VBD NP PP .
but , CC , PRP VBP SBAR ?
PRP VBZ S . PRP VBZ PP .
and PRP VBZ VP .
RB NP VP .
but PRP VBP VP .
what do you think DT NN NN IN S ?
CD , RB JJ .
now NN IN NP is , S .
WP NP VP is NP VP .
never RB , RB VB NP , but PRP VBP PP , PP .
and DT VBD NP .
PRP VBD NP .
IN NP , DT NN RB VBD SBAR .
and RB PRP VBD .
and i studied IN NP IN NP .
and PRP VBD NP .
i memor@@ i@@ zed in PRP$ NN NN DT NNS CC NNS IN NP .
PRP RB VBD NP PP .
and PDT DT NN , PRP VBD VP .
and PRP VBD SBAR .
and i came out of medical school with the impres@@ sion that if i VBD NP and VBD NP , or ADVP SBAR , ADVP , SBAR .
and PRP VBD PP , SBAR .
i was DT NN IN NP RB in NNP WRB NP VP .
IN NP PRP VBD VP .
and it was NP , SBAR , VP .
and VP .
and NP VP , and NP VP .
and WHADVP S , PRP VBD VP .
and when PRP VBD PP PP , i could hear JJ NNS IN NP .
this is a condition in WDT DT NN VBZ , and instead of being able VP , some of the blood bac@@ ks up into the lung , the l@@ ung@@ s fill up with blood , and that &apos;s why you have NP PP .
and NP SBAR .
NP VP and NP VP .
PRP VBD NP NP . PRP VBD NP S .
i gave PRP$ NNS IN S .
and IN NP , PRP VBD S .
and PRP VBD ADJP .
CC NP VP ; NP VP .
RB , PRP VBD NP .
PRP VBD NP PP .
i didn JJ NN VP CC VP , which VBD S so he would have DT NN S .
and PRP VBD S .
RB PRP VBD NP PP .
RB PRP VBP SBAR .
maybe i wanted to VB NP without RB VBG S .
NP SBAR VBD ADJP .
in sending PRP$ NN , i dis@@ re@@ gar@@ ded NP ADVP VBD VP . don &apos; t do this . &quot;
in fact , so l@@ ac@@ king IN NP was i that NP ADVP VP , &quot; do you think NP VP ? &quot;
and DT NN VP CC VP - ADJP VBP ADJP . &quot;
PRP MD VP .
S , CC S , NNS VBD S .
and PRP VBD ADVP PP .
PDT DT NN IN NP , that after@@ noon , i had NP PP .
but PRP VBD PRT PP .
and at the end of DT NN , i pac@@ ked up TO VP and walked to DT NN NN TO VP .
PRP VBD PP ADVP .
and it was there that DT NN , NP SBAR , said CD NNS IN NP that are NP SBAR .
NNS IN NP NP VP , but NP VP .
DT CD NNS VBP : SQ ?
NNP do PRP VB SBAR ? &quot;
DT JJ NN VBD NP .
RB RB PRP VBZ NP .
UH PRP VBD ADJP .
PRP VBD UCP .
about an hour after she had VBN ADVP , SBAR , she collap@@ sed and her family called 9@@ 11 and the par@@ am@@ edi@@ cs brought her back to the emergen@@ cy department where she had NP , SBAR .
and NP VP and NP VP .
and DT NN . NN VBD PRT NP .
PRP VBD NP S .
PRP VBD NP PP .
and PRP VBD UCP .
and i went through DT NML , because S , CC S .
and over DT JJ QP NNS , it was JJ IN S .
PRP VBD NP .
and DT NN VBD .
and IN NP , PRP VBD NP PP .
and at RB DT NML NN , they VBD S -- NP , NP , NP CC NP .
PRP VBP SBAR .
and DT VBD NP .
over the next few weeks , i beat myself up and i experienced for the first time the un@@ healthy sh@@ ame that exists IN NP -- WHADVP S , IN S .
you know that healthy kind , when you betra@@ y a secret that NP VP , i &apos;ll never make that mistake again .
and NP VP and NP ADVP VP .
DT VBZ NP .
NP SBAR VBZ NP .
it &apos;s NP SBAR , RB SBAR , CC SBAR .
and PRP VBD SBAR .
and PRP VBD NP SBAR .
PRP VBD PP , and PRP VBP ADJP SBAR .
and PRP VBD S .
WRB VP ? WRB VBD NP VP ?
and ADVP IN NP ?
WRB VBD NP VP ?
RB CC RB , PRP VBD .
PRP VBD S .
and on DT JJ NN , there was NP PP and the sun started VP and i wonder@@ ed , RB S .
and i made myself a bar@@ gain that SBAR , S VP .
and PRP VBD .
and PRP VBD ADVP PP .
and RB PRP VBD ADVP .
CD NNS later i was NP PP PP , and i saw DT ADJP NN IN NP .
NP VP , PRP VBD PP .
PRP VBD S .
NP VP , PRP VBD ADJP .
and PRP VP CC VP .
and RB IN S , PRP VBD ADVP ADVP .
and two days later i came S , and IN S .
and PRP VBD NP : SQ
NNP do PRP VB SBAR ? &quot;
INTJ NP VP , PRP VBD SBAR .
PRP VBD NP .
you can VB NP , but PRP VBZ NP PP , and PRP MD ADVP VP .
and RB PRP VB NP .
NP VP and NP VP .
and i went IN NP and felt VBN and went RB PP , IN S .
ADVP IN NP , PRP VBD NP .
now that takes NP VP .
RB in DT NNS , PRP VBP S and PRP VBP SBAR .
NP SBAR VBD NP .
i or@@ dered a kid@@ ney x-@@ ray . when it turned RP VP , my collea@@ gue who VBD VP noticed some ten@@ der@@ ness in NP NP and called the surge@@ ons .
DT JJ NN VBD NP .
PRP VP CC VP .
and PRP VP CC VP .
IN NP , NP VP and NP VP .
but DT NN , PRP VBD VP .
and i &apos;d like VP , WHNP S .
NP PP VBP VP .
RB , JJ CC JJ .
here &apos;s the problem : if PRP MD VP , if i can &apos; NP VP , how can i share it with my colleagues ?
WRB MD NP VP ?
if PRP VBD S .
WRB VBD NP ?
UH UH , PRP VBP PP and PRP MD VP , but you &apos;re not VBG S .
if i were to walk IN NP and VB PP ADVP and VB S , i probably wouldn &apos; t get through two of those stories before they would start VP , somebody would cra@@ ck a jo@@ ke , they &apos;d change the subject and we would move on .
and in fact , if PRP VBD and PRP$ NNS VBD SBAR , i &apos;d VBP NP .
DT VBZ NP .
PRP VBZ NP .
it &apos;s a system in WDT EX VBP NP -- those who VBP NP , those who MD VP , those who VBP NP and those who VBP NP .
and PRP VBZ ADVP PP , SBAR .
and we have DT NN IN SBARQ .
but EX VBP NP .
in my 20 years or so of medical broad@@ ca@@ sting and journ@@ alism , i &apos;ve made a personal study of JJ NN and JJ NNS to learn NP SBAR , IN NP . &quot;
and WHNP S VBZ SBAR .
we work in a system where er@@ r@@ ors happen NP VP .
IN NP , NP PP VBP PP .
IN NP , NP PP VBD NP PP .
in DT NNS , these are JJ SBAR IN S .
and RB VBZ DT NN .
in NP SBAR , we can VB S .
NN NN VBZ ADJP .
PRP MD VP .
we have PRP$ JJ NNS , IN IN S .
now take DT JJ NN IN NP , make NP ADJP and put NP PP IN NP , and suddenly my history is l@@ ac@@ ed IN NP .
PRP VBP S .
NP VP ; NP VP .
and PRP$ NNS IN NP ; PRP VBP S .
VBN NP , NNS VBP ADJP .
so if PRP VBP NP out all the error - prone health profession@@ als , well there won JJ NN VB NP .
and PRP VBP SBAR ?
on my show , on &quot; white co@@ at , black art , &quot; i made it a hab@@ it of saying , &quot; RB VBZ NP , NP , &quot; here &apos;s PRP$ JJS NN , NN NN , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , &quot; what about y@@ ours ? &quot; and i would point the micro@@ phone towards them .
and PRP$ NNS MD VP , NP VP , then PRP MD VP .
PRP VBP S . PRP VBP S .
they want VP . &quot;
WHNP S VBZ NP .
WHNP S VBZ NP .
and PRP VBZ PP .
the re@@ defined physi@@ cian is human , knows NP VP , but stri@@ ves TO VP .
PRP VBZ NP PP .
PRP VBZ ADJP SBAR .
and she points out other people &apos;s mistakes , not IN NP , but IN NP so that NP VP .
and she works in NP PP , and when JJ NNS VB NP , they will make NNS IN NP IN NP .
so the system is evol@@ ving to create bac@@ ku@@ ps that VBP S , SBAR , we &apos;re re@@ war@@ ded for coming clean .
PRP$ NN VBZ NP .
PRP VBP NP .
PRP VBP ADJP . PRP VBP NP .
PRP VBP ADJP , but PRP VBP S .
NP ADVP VP , but NP VP .
and VP : PRP VBP VP .
PRP VBP VP .
and DT VBZ PP .
and because NP VP , i will VB NP NP SBAR .
and DT JJ NN VBZ PP , NP .
and PRP VBD ADVP , SBAR .
and PRP VBP S .
PRP VBD ADVP VP .
and PRP VBD NP . &quot;
DT VBD NP .
DT NML VBD VP .
RB DT NN VBZ PP .
RB this story , NP VP , so there is NN JJ PP .
but DT NN VBZ , SBAR .
PRP RB VBP SBAR .
DT NNS RB VBP SBAR .
RB WP VP ?
DT JJ NN , ADVP VP , VBZ VP .
because NP VP .
NP VP and NP VP .
and PRP VBD SBAR .
and NP VP , and NP VP .
DT VBD NP .
and DT NN VBD VP .
and PRP VBD NP .
and NP PP VBD NP and PRP VBD NP and PRP VBD NP PP .
WHADVP S , DT NN VBD VP .
PRP VBD VP .
PRP VBD VP .
RB VBD ADVP NP .
PRP VBD ADVP ADVP .
and DT NN RB VBD ADJP .
ADVP NP VP , but NP VP .
PRP$ JJ JJ NN VBZ SBAR .
IN NP -- NN VBD NP .
NN NN VBD S and NP , ADJP , VBZ VP .
and PRP VBD NP PP , and PRP VBD NP PP .
and WHNP S , PRP VBP SBAR .
SBAR , NP VP , VBZ NP PP .
and NP PP VBD NP .
and actually JJS IN NP , NP VP , were JJ NN NN .
RB NP PP VP CC ADVP VP .
and DT NNS VBP ADJP .
IN NP , NP VP and ADVP NP VP .
the bottom is VBN PP , PP PP .
DT VBZ NP .
NP VP , PRP VBD VP .
and CD NN PRP VBD NP .
PRP VBD RB VP .
and RB PRP VBD S .
NP PP VBZ ADVP VP they go IN NP .
but PRP VBZ ADJP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
NP VP , and NP VP .
IN S , NP PP VBZ .
you have IN NP NP : NP .
and PP NP VP -- NP VP , or RB .
every generation will VB NP .
and NP ADVP , PRP VBP PP .
but PRP VBP S .
PRP MD VP .
IN NP PRP VBP S .
and NP , PP , VBZ SBAR .
PRP VBP S .
now one should think S .
RB , RB , NP SBAR , IN S , PRP VBZ ADJP .
RB PRP VBP SBAR .
PRP RB VBP NP .
and RB PRP VBP RB VP .
IN NP , PRP VBP PP .
PRP VBP ADJP .
PP NP VP and NP VP .
and DT NN VBZ , SBARQ
RB SBAR JJ NNS VBP SBAR .
and IN NP , NP PP MD VP .
and NP VP they would VB NP .
for example , the an@@ ec@@ do@@ te that NP VP VP CC VP &apos;s not &quot; scientific . &quot;
so you have a situation WHADVP S , even IN S , because NP VP .
and RB , NP PP MD VP .
IN PP , PRP RB VBP NP .
PRP VP CC VP .
that is for NP SBAR .
how about NP SBAR VBP NP SBAR ?
RB PRP VBP SBAR .
DT VBZ NP .
RB VBD NP .
and PRP MD VP . &quot;
and if you think IN NP IN S ?
because NP VP .
and so PRP$ NN , S , is IN NP VP .
VBP NP ADVP .
in NP PP , if NP VP , you had VP .
PRP VBD S .
and DT VBD VP .
if NP VP , they could VB PRT SBAR .
and PRP IN NP understand WHADVP S , WHADJP S .
PRP MD ADVP VP .
but today in 2011 , if you go and buy a NN NN prin@@ ter from DT JJ NML NN and print a page , that NN will end up having s@@ light yellow dots prin@@ ted on NP PP .
DT VBZ VP .
and NN VBZ S .
and this is NP PP .
and DT VBZ NP .
if NP VP , we can NN NP .
PRP VBP NP .
PRP VBP NP .
UH RB , PRP VBP NP .
and NP PP VBP ADJP .
DT NNS VBP NP .
PRP VBP NP S .
PRP RB VBP NP .
RB NNS NML IN NP .
DT VBZ VP .
DT VBZ NP .
DT VBZ NP .
DT VBZ NP .
these guys make their fortun@@ es online , but they make it through the illegal means of VP , or with key@@ log@@ gers TO VP .
the u.s. secret service , two months ago , fro@@ ze DT JJ NN NN IN NP here , and that bank account had NP PP WHADVP S .
NP NP VP ; NP VP .
and i cla@@ im NP VP that NP VP .
and PRP VBZ ADJP SBAR .
IN NP , NP PP MD VP .
NP PP VBP RB VP .
they &apos;re VP : VP PP , VP , VP .
NNS IN ADJP VBP VP and VBP VP .
so those are NP : NP , ha@@ ck@@ tivi@@ sts like JJ doing it for DT NN , but then the last group are NN NNS , NP VP .
and RB PRP VBP PP .
DT VBZ NP .
NP VP -- or ADVP , NP VP .
PRP VBD VP .
NP VP and NP VP .
and i asked last week in DT NN IN NP , PRP VBD NP SBAR .
and PRP$ NN VBD INTJ .
RB WRB VBP NP VP ?
UH NN VBZ NP .
PRP VBP NP .
WP VBP NP VP ?
well you need DT NN IN S .
now we all , or a big part of us , use g@@ mail or one of their competi@@ tors , but these services are especially popular in tot@@ al@@ it@@ arian states like iran , where dis@@ si@@ dents use foreign services like g@@ mail because they know S , so the local government can &apos; t s@@ no@@ op on their discus@@ sions .
except NP VP .
and NP NP .
and DT VBZ SBAR .
WP IN NP ?
well in NN , the ri@@ ot@@ ers lo@@ ot@@ ed NP PP IN NP , and WRB NP VP they found NP PP .
IN NP , VBD NP . &quot;
and within that bin@@ der were notes from NP PP PP : and in NP : NP .
PRP VBD VP .
DT NN NN VBP ADVP .
ADJP NNS VBP VP .
but JJ NNS VBP VP .
for example , in germany , just a couple of NNS IN NP was found , WDT VP .
if NP VP , your phone will VB VP .
but NN , PRP VBZ PP .
PRP MD VP .
they will even use NNS IN NP to VP .
now when PRP VBP NP PP , the obvious response from NNS should be IN , S , but that doesn &apos; t really affect me because NP VP .
WRB MD NP VP ?
because NP VP . &quot;
and DT VBZ NP .
NN VBZ VP .
NN VBZ RB PP .
DT VBZ RB NP .
PRP VBZ NP .
and while PRP MD VP , any right NP VP will be VBN PRT PP .
and do we VB , VBP SBAR , NP , NP ?
and DT VBP NP .
NP VP , but NP VP .
the first con@@ cre@@ te blocks were VBN PP PP .
RB RB JJ NNS VBD NP .
they en@@ ab@@ led PRP VP .
RB JJ NNS VBD VP .
ADVP IN NP , NN VBD PRT PP .
PRP VBD VP .
and IN NP , NN NNS VBD NP PP .
it &apos;s VBN SBAR .
PRP VBP SBAR .
NN VBD S .
le@@ go VBZ ADVP VP and VBD NP PP .
mean@@ while the ex@@ act same year , at NN NNS the next revolution was RB VP .
the transi@@ st@@ or VP pil@@ ed on NP PP to DT NN WRB NP VP .
like DT JJ NN , the transi@@ st@@ or allows NP VP .
but RB VBZ NP : NP VP .
PRP RB VBP S , SBAR , so PRP VBD S .
eight years ago when PRP VBD PP , i started VBG NP .
NP PP VBD NP .
VB S .
NNS VBP NP .
PRP VBP ADJP , NP .
and NP PP VBZ SBAR .
RB PRP MD VP .
DT NNS VBP ADJP .
NP VP , NP VP , NP VP and NP VP .
RB RB PRP VBP S and RB RB PRP MD VP .
NP VP , PRP MD VP .
NP VP and ADVP NP VP .
VB PRT NP , and RB PRP VBP VP .
VP and NP VP .
PRP VBP VP .
RB RB NP , NP VBP ADVP ADJP .
instead of VP , li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its allow PRP IN NP .
so TO VP , you MD ADVP VP and ADVP VBP S .
NP PP VBZ SBAR .
PRP VBP S .
NNS , VP , NP , NP MD VP .
PRP VBP VP .
and PRP VBZ VP .
the ni@@ c@@ est thing is WHADVP S .
for NN , WHADVP S , or WHADVP S , or WHADVP S .
PRP VBP ADVP VP .
so IN NP , we &apos;ve SINV .
ADVP NP VP , PRP VBP NP ...
a few weeks ago we took li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its TO VP and gave them to NP PP and told PRP VB VP . &quot;
RB VBZ NP NNP NN .
but VB , SBAR .
PRP VBZ NP .
IN NP , S , NNS VBD NP .
and PRP VBP S .
RB NNS VBZ NP .
PRP MD VP .
we want TO VP .
RB VP CC VP .
VBP NP .
